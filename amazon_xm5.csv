I appreciate the partial metal construction and the plush ear and headbands. However, this comes with a drawback the right ear, where the metal clamps the plastic, sometimes squeaks and needs adjustment. It's not a major issue, but it can be irritating.On the Sony side, I actually prefer the plastic they've used compared to the plastic parts on the Bose as it has more of a soft touch feel to it.ComfortThis is where the Bose really shines and, in my opinion, the biggest downfall for Sony. While I loved almost everything about the XM5, I found them to be uncomfortable at the headband area. It even gave me minor headaches after wearing them for about an hour.The Bose QuietComfort Ultra, on the other hand, truly lives up to its name. For me, these are insanely comfortable, and this is the main win for Bose in my book.Sound QualityInterestingly, my experience differs from many reviewers. Out of the box, I found the Sony's sound to be subpar. However, after EQ customization, I actually prefer the Sony's sound. I love how crisp it is, with decent vocals, likely due to the LDAC and Hi-Res capabilities.The Bose sound is pretty decent and bass-heavy. One thing I noticed is that the Bose seems to have tighter, more pronounced bass, especially at lower volumes. The Sony's bass felt a bit rumbly in comparison.But as an overall sound quality I like the sony more.ANC (Active Noise Cancellation):Both are very good, but in my very unscientific testing at home with my kids, and in the mall and cafe, it seems that Bose is better at blocking more noise. But again, both are pretty impressive in this department.Microphones and Phone CallsI found that both perform well, but excel in different settings. In a quiet environment, the Bose provides clearer sound quality. However, in noisy environments, Sony does a great job with noise gating and blocking external noise. The same goes for wind noise, with Sony being much better at handling it.I would say if Phone Calls is a priority definitely go with Sony especially if you'll be making phone calls in noisy environments.Transparency ModeBose is significantly better, sounding as if you're not wearing anything. The Sony, in contrast, sounds a bit muffled and robotic. Personally, I don't care much about this feature as long as I can hear my surroundings.FunctionalityIn my opinion, this is a home run for Sony. The touch controls work flawlessly, and I love the feature where covering the right ear lets you hear your surrounding. The voice assistant works perfectly, and I find the Sony app miles better than Bose's. The ear detection on Sony is also better.Bose, on the other hand, has no quick access to Transparency mode other than having to long press the button to change the ANC, and I've experienced several bugs, like unexpected pausing (likely due to the on-ear detection) and issues with cycling through ANC modes.ConnectionBoth are great and have no issues for me with connection.Final ThoughtsI really loved almost everything about the Sony, but its comfort issue was a deal-breaker for me. The Bose might be mediocre in most aspects, but it excels in comfort and ANC, which was enough for me to keep it and return the Sony.Given my misophonia and tendency for allodynia, the comfort factor is crucial. If you can wear the Sony comfortably for long periods, I believe it's the better choice overall but for ultimate comfort, Bose wins hands down.In the end, I chose the Bose QuietComfort Ultra for its superior comfort and slightly better ANC, despite preferring many of Sony's features and sound quality Also the numerous posts about broken Sony hinges worried me slightly.","January 19, 2025","4.0","Sony xm5 vs bose qc ultra.","Ahmed ElbazAhmed Elbaz","Color: Black","False"

It was Black Friday / Syber Monday 2024 and I figured why not drop some money and help everyone else figure out which headphones are the best. I did not test anything $600 or more. These headphones were mid level, where most buyers are. With incredibly pricing, some of these were downright a steal!I am going to break them down into a few categories (Sound Quality, price value, bluetooth app Connection, comfort, style) and give you the results on each category. I could not test longevity since I just got them all, so I will leave that for other reviewers.The headphones I tested were the:Beats Studio Pro XSony WH-1000XM5Technics WirelessBowers & Wilkins Px7 S2eBose QuietComfort UltraThe overall winner for those who don't want to read why is............. Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2eSound QualityWinner: Bowers and Wilkins PX7S2eRunner Up: Technics WirelessComments: This one was hard to pick a winner. Bowers and Technics were dang near neck and neck. You can't go wrong with either. I had to go back and forth 10X to finally figure it out with all the songs I played. Some songs, Technics was better, some Bowers better. What it came down to was the immersion of sound. I felt Technics had the better highs and crisp voice sounds so if you are going for vocals, I would say Technics, but Bowers had a better feeling of overall broad balance of sound, lows and immersion.The Bose and Sony were 3rd and 4th. Beats last. Beats are great headphones, but they just didn't have the stable / predictable sound that Bose and Sony had.Price ValueBeats Studio Pro X ($159)Sony WH-1000XM5 ($298)Technics Wireless ($172)Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e ($249)Bose QuietComfort Ultra ($329)Winner: Technics WirelessRunner Up: Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2eComments: For $172 the technics are hands down the best value / bargain of any headphone I have ever had. I have heard they have issues breaking on the hinge, so I can't comment on longevity, but for sound quality and price, there is nothing close to the Technics. I got them on sale, so not sure if they are going to be that price forever. My review on this would change if the price went back up.Bowers and Wilkins at $249 was unreal for the winning headphone. What a great deal. Beats are nice gifts, but nothing I would own now after reviewing these others. Sony was way overprices. Bose, utter disappointment for their pricing. Bose is a solid 8 across the board but never a 10.AppWinner: Technics WirelessRunner Up: Bose QuietComfort UltraComments: I felt the Technics were the best overall app. Super easy for the normal user. Lots of easy sound options to choose from like bass+, vocal, treble+, dynamic. No weird screens. Just easy. I felt Bowers really dropped the ball on the app here and their app seemed a bit complicated with no pre settings to choose from. This was a bummer. Bose is always a steady 8, but never a 10. Good app, but not incredible. Just good and dependable. Sony, meh. they should change their name to always over complicate everything, but if you get it figured out they rock. Beats did a decent job.. Nothing I will remember.Bluetooth ConnectionWinner: All of them. I had zero issues with any, so they all get at least one spot on the winner podium.ComfortWinner: Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2eRunner Up: BoseComments: Bowers felt the best for sure. They just fit awesome. No doubt about it. Clearly the winner. Bose is a distant second. Beats felt really good actually so it took 3rd place. Technics is fourth but a bit stiff. Not quite as comfortable as the others. Sony was shallow so your ears hit the speaker cloth, which dropped to last place. If not for that, Sony would be number 3.StyleWinner: Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2eRunner Up: BeatsComments: Bowers hands down looks and feels like quality. Winner for sure. Beats colors are rad and they look amazing. Everyone compliments beats colors so they take runner up. Technics looks kind of cheap but they are not and this frustrates me as they have such a great brand, why cheapen them with such a cheap looking stainless design. Everyone loves the new flat colors and quality builds, not a headphone that looks like an outdated stainless steel refrigerator from the 2010 era.Final thoughts. Overall, Bowers is the best overall headphone, but dang, Technics is really an audio guys headphone if you want to hear certain highs and distant lows that should be your choice. Bose is a 8 out of 10 on everything, never a winner on anything. Sony was a disappointment to be honest. Beats is fine for style but lacking in the areas that matter the most.Long live Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e this time around. Good job.","December 6, 2024","3.0","I tested the top 5 reasonably priced headphones and here is my review so you don't have to","Trevor MTrevor M","Color: Smoky Pink","True"

I recently purchased the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, and they exceeded my already high expectations. These headphones are a masterpiece in design, functionality, and sound quality. Here’s why I’m giving them five stars:Sound Quality:The audio is crystal clear with deep, rich bass and perfectly balanced mids and highs. Whether you’re listening to music, podcasts, or watching movies, the sound is immersive and true to the source. The built-in LDAC codec really makes a difference if you’re streaming from high-quality sources.Noise Cancellation:The noise cancellation is phenomenal—easily the best I’ve experienced. The headphones block out background noise in various environments, from the hum of an airplane to chatter in a busy café. It’s like stepping into a soundproof room.Comfort:The XM5s are lightweight with plush ear cups that make them comfortable for extended wear. I’ve worn them for hours without any discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a perfect fit.Battery Life:Sony advertises up to 30 hours of battery life, and they deliver. A single charge lasts me days of regular use. Plus, the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—3 minutes of charging for 3 hours of playback is amazing.Features & App:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive. The adaptive sound control is a standout feature, automatically adjusting noise cancellation based on your activity and environment. The Sony Headphones Connect app lets you customize everything to your liking, from the equalizer to noise-canceling levels.Design:The design is sleek and modern. They look and feel premium, with a matte finish that resists fingerprints. The carrying case is well-designed for travel.Cons (Barely Worth Mentioning):The price is on the higher side, but you’re absolutely getting what you pay for.No folding design like the previous model, but the included case is compact and sturdy.","November 19, 2024","5.0","Gold standard in wireless headphones","CC","Color: Black","False"

One of the hinges broke from normal desk use for 18 months. A more paranoid person might think they were intentionally designed to break right after the warranty expires. It's also a pretty horrible part to break as taping it back together is tricky and it doesn't last for long before needing to be re-taped.I was always SUPER gentle with them, never dropped, twisted, or yanked on them -- always took them off with both hands. Even if I did, I'd expect a $400 pair of headphones to be able to take a little bit more wear.My old Sony XM2 is far better built and is still going strong.

While the wiring remained intact and the headphones still connected, the hinge was clearly broken and required repair. Disappointingly, this happened almost exactly a year after purchase.I contacted Sony and sent them in for repair, only to be told that the replacement hinge (a small piece of plastic less than an inch long) would cost $270—plus service charges, which made the total repair cost more than the original price of the headphones. Since the warranty had expired, none of this was covered.Now, I’ll admit, I didn't always use the protective case, but as a commuter, I found the case to be bulky and inconvenient. The hinge broke when I set the headphones down with very little force, which made me question their durability. You can see from the picture that I got plenty of use out of them, so perhaps I should have purchased an extended warranty.

Wind was the major issue in Gen 4. It's no longer a problem.Distance has also been increased pretty dramatically. I can go clear across rooms and through walls and still get crystal clear signal.Cons: The system is trying to be way too smart. I'll be wearing the headphones while listening to music or even a call and they'll just decide to turn off. Battery still at 70%.The touchpad is waaaaay more sensitive than it needs to be. I'll be wearing them around my neck and it's constantly donking music on and off. And this is because...They no longer lie flat with the cup side down on your collar bone. now, the new jutting joints  lie against your collarbone as well as the touchpad.The phones are also thinner. The ANC is better but the thinner padding and cups seem to be less insulated than prior gens, so without ANC they let in more noise. This is an issue if you wear glasses as the foam never recovers it's shape. This also means my ears constantly rub on the fabric.No more mechanical detents. It's friction fit for the headband. Which lets you get more adjustment but it just seems to sag down over time. Ive replaced the cups in my previous headphones until water damage destroyed them and the detents never wore out there.And an additional note, it doesn't come with the airplane jack adapter. While lots of planes have finally gone with one stereo jack instead of two monos, not every flight has done this.

Sony has taken an already excellent line of headphones and refined every aspect with this iteration, making the WH-1000XM5 a must-have for any serious music lover or traveler.Sound Quality:The XM5 excels in sound performance, offering a rich, immersive, and smooth audio experience.

The transitions between the bass, mids, and highs are incredibly smooth, and the overall sound signature is detailed but not overwhelming. The bass is punchy without being overbearing, and the mid-range is well-pronounced, allowing vocals and instruments to shine. This results in a truly enjoyable listening experience, whether I’m listening to music, watching movies, or taking a phone call.Noise Cancellation:The noise-canceling technology in the XM5 is outstanding. Sony has always been a leader in this area, and the WH-1000XM5 continues that tradition. It blocks out nearly all external noise, from the hum of an airplane to the chatter in a busy café. The adaptive sound control is intuitive and automatically adjusts the noise cancellation level depending on my environment. It’s perfect for long flights, public transportation, or even working in noisy spaces.Comfort:Comfort is often overlooked, but it’s critical, especially for those who use headphones for extended periods. The XM5 is incredibly comfortable, with soft, plush ear cups and an adjustable headband that fits snugly without causing any pressure on the ears or head. Even after hours of wear, I don’t experience any discomfort. The lighter weight compared to previous models is a noticeable improvement, making them perfect for long sessions.Battery Life:The battery life is stellar, with around 30 hours of continuous playback with active noise canceling enabled. Charging is fast as well, with just 10 minutes providing up to 5 hours of playback. This makes it incredibly convenient when you’re in a rush or forgot to charge them overnight.Design and Build:Sony has refined the design of the XM5, making them sleek and modern. The headphones have a premium look and feel, with high-quality materials used throughout. I particularly appreciate the subtle but stylish design, which looks sophisticated without being overly flashy.Features and Connectivity:Sony has packed the XM5 with an impressive array of features. The touch controls on the ear cups are responsive and easy to use, allowing me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and take calls with simple gestures. The Speak-to-Chat feature is incredibly useful, as it pauses music automatically when I start speaking, resuming once I’m done. It also pairs effortlessly with multiple devices, thanks to Bluetooth multipoint, so I can seamlessly switch between my phone and laptop. Additionally, the call quality is crystal clear, and the microphones do an excellent job of isolating my voice from background noise.Verdict:Overall, the Sony WH-1000XM5 delivers in every area that matters. The sound quality is warm and rich, with exceptional noise-cancellation that rivals the best in the industry. They’re comfortable enough for all-day wear, packed with intelligent features, and have impressive battery life. Whether you’re a music enthusiast, a frequent traveler, or someone who just appreciates high-quality audio, the XM5 is worth every penny. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a top-tier audio experience with unmatched comfort and noise-canceling capabilities.","September 11, 2024","5.0","Exceptional Sound, Superior Comfort, and Cutting-Edge Features","JDRSJDRS","Color: Midnight Blue","False"

Deduction of 1 star for this. These are built much better than the 720N but also cost 3 times as much. I have Logitech PC headsets that is half this price and it's built much better. Sony chose to use a thin cheap plastic. It's light which is nice but I do feel I have to be careful with these and not my PC headset for example.- No IPX waterproof rating. Again for the price point and build quality it should be.-The ""hard"" carry case is thin cardboard inside a thin cotton shell. Provides the bare minimum of protection for a hard case and once again seems like they cheaped out on materials-Overall I decided to keep the product. It performs well, is comfortable, works between Apple and Android seamlessly, and does a pretty good job at noise cancelling.

They make airline travel (both waiting in the noisy terminal and riding on the plane) so much more pleasant; I find myself feeling much less tired after a plane ride when I wear these. I also wear them when I'm operating my noisy yard equipment, especially my mower and weed whacker, and when I'm long-haul driving on noisy highways. The noise cancellation is so good that I can listen to music and audiobooks while driving a cab-less tractor without cranking the volume, so my ears don't feel achy or tired even after hours of work. The sound quality is really good whether I'm listening in noisy or quiet environments, and the microphone is excellent for phone calls too. I'm especially impressed that people on the other end of calls tell me they can't hear any background noise, even when I'm calling from a noisy environment.The padding on the earpieces and underside of the headband is so soft and comfortable. The headphones stay put on my head without creating pressure points around my ears or the top of my head, which has been a problem for me with other headphones.The only downside of these headphones (I'd would remove 1 star for this, except that everything else about the headphones is so great that it doesn't seem fair to give it less than 5 stars) is that the mobile app that connects to the headphones is hard to use and frequently resets the headphones to a setting that turns off the noise cancellation when I don't want it to. Sometimes I feel like I'm fighting with the mobile app to keep the noise cancellation turned on.","August 22, 2024","5.0","The perfect companion for airline travel and noisy yardwork","Elizabeth BElizabeth B","Color: Midnight Blue","True"

There's a metal sleeve about 1/8"" long that is knurled and pressed into a plastic tube, and that is the pivot point that lets them lay flat on your ear. As seems obvious to this retired engineer, shoving a metal part only 1/8"" into a plastic sleave isn't going to hold up to anything. This joint has a 4"" lever arm for you to pry the 1/8"" of plastic out, which is astounding. I've bought a lot of cheap headphones and abused them outside, yet none of them have died so easily.I will say the sound quality and noise cancelling is very good. On par with a $200 apple product I lost.For how cheaply they're made, they should cost about $30. With the sound quality, I'd bump that up to $100. The earbud in the photo is a $30 set that I use outside in the rain, carry in my pocket for days at a time, and sometimes chase my German Shephard to get them back, yet they have held up much better than this $330 set.And the shutting off while I'm watching a movie is irritating, and it's been doing that since brand new.Also, there's a designed feature that pauses your movie if it detects you possibly removing the headphones. It's not great at telling the difference, particularly since I often slip one cup off one ear so I can see if something is making noise in the house, but I don't want my movie to pause. I wish I could shut off that feature, but I can't seem to. It seemed really handy to me until I used it a while and it's wrong more often than it's right.","July 27, 2024","1.0","Comes apart with light use.

I really enjoyed them minus their touch controls feature which I turned off and some wonkiness with the multi-device connectivity.I treated them as best I could, always using their supplied case to transport them, didn't drop them or scratch them. About a month ago, the headband started to peel on the left side. It seemed really premature and contacted Sony Support to inquire about replacing or repairing the headband. Apparently you can't simply replace the headband and the warranty doesn't cover cosmetic damage. It seems to be a fairly common issue when doing some searching on Google. Whatever it's only cosmetic.A couple days ago, the left headphone basically broke off from the band when I picked it up. Once again, appears to be a fairly common failure. Contacted Sony Support and apparently the 1-year warranty only covers things like if it doesn't power on.It was a $430 pair of headphones that has basically managed to disintegrate under normal use in less than a year. In my opinion, the build quality seems to be less than many budget pairs here on Amazon yet, for over $400, Sony seems to have zero real intention of standing behind its products for even the 1-year warranty period.","July 3, 2024","1.0","Broke in under a year...

They're actually some really nice looking headphones.Sound- these are absolutely incredible I'm hearing notes and backup singers and different nuances in music I didn't know existed and I've tried four or five different of the top line pairs including the JBLs, the  boses, and the studio beats pro.These absolutey beat every other pair I tried and it wasn't even close. If I had to rate them in order these will be number one, The beats pro would come in at number two, The JBLs were number three and bose would be dead last.Comfort: I can wear these all day with no problem My ears will not be hurting the headphones themselves are very plush and comfortable and I have a smaller head in comparison to a lot of the headphones I've tried and the adjustment sizes are really great no matter what your head size is. The only downside is of how insulated I think the inner ear cuffs are because it will make your ear sweat after a while because it keeps your ears pretty toasty.And coming up on the number one reason why I bought these, these by far have the clearest sounding calls of all the headphones I've tried people on the other line can hear me clearly I can hear them clearly the Bluetooth syncs pretty effortlessly.Even the custom sound profiles that you can access during the app make it even better.The battery life is pretty good I can go pretty much 3 days 4 days without charging on one use I would have to say you probably can get a solid 24-30 hours runtime out of them.Literally the only thing that could be better on these is since they are made by Sony you would think they would hook up effortlessly to the PS5 and it does not which is really annoying considering it's the same company. You can still hook them up via audio jack into your controller and it works fine but I just think it's ridiculous that Sony will not let it be Bluetooth compatible to another Sony product like that.Overall even though it's pricey I think it's worth it and you're not going to do better than these headphones.Yes I actually own this product and I paid full price for them I am not a reviewer In fact I hardly ever come on here to review unless something's really great or something's really terrible.","July 1, 2024","5.0","Love these!","SteveSteve","Color: Silver","True"

I decided to return the XM5 and go with the Max. The sound quality on the XM5 is pretty good but the bass is not good at all.

If I had sat on the headphones or some other mishap had caused the break and I had any degree of confidence that it wouldn’t happened again I might take the plunge. Unfortunately I the only confidence I have is that this will happen again as I firmly believe that this is a major design flaw on some otherwise stellar headphones.My son had a similar issue with a pair of Razer gaming headphones a few years ago – they were near new, and just… broke. And guess what? They replaced them without hassle because they have a warranty and a brand that they stand behind.For what it’s worth, I work in music and I’ve owned dozens of pairs of headphones over the years and put a million miles on them all: AKG, Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, Denon, Koss – none of them ever failed like this. And, I’ve had a pair of SONY WH-1000XM3 Wireless headphones since 2019 and they’re still trucking. I thought I was upgrading…But hey, they sounded great while they lasted. If you’ve got money to burn, take a shot. Maybe yours will last over a year.","May 10, 2024","1.0","Fatal design flaw and Sony DOES NOT CARE.

I use these in the office and takle them on and of all the time and it takes too long to hold the power button down for 5 seconds so I don't come back to a dead battery.Of course it did not do this in the return window, so I wasted $350.After the nineteyleventh time of them turning off while in a call and speaking, I threw them across the room in frustruation.And I spent way too much time having to fiddle with things. I don't know how the side-tap button is supposed to be useful, because it activates whenever I use my hand to move the headphones.

This resulted in setup complications with the 360 surround services and raised concerns about the authenticity of the product and Amazon's quality control processes.It was disappointing to encounter such a setback with what should have been a brand-new product.

They did not want to even listen to my argument that it was not an accidental damage but one of the joints (held with glue) just came off, so it was a manufacturing issue.The contractor told me to ship the headphones to them at my own expense and they would charge me $90.00 just to tell me how much it would cost to repair, and then they would ship it back to me at my own expense.I have decided to write off the loss and buy Apple Air Pods Pro.

They are fairly comfortable, but they warm your ears a bit. The OEM ear pads beat anything I have found aftermarket surprisingly. The ANC is pretty good, nothing mind blowing, but definitely better than a lot of the competition, and about on par with the airpod max. The sound is very okay, it’s quite bass heavy, and the sound is overall pretty warm, and it lacks good imaging and has poor soundstage, but to most consumers, they are okay. Compared to the airpod max for example (which are pretty bright), I prefer the warmer sound because a lot of it can be fixed in EQ on the app (i turn the bass down a little, and I boost the mid a tiny bit and the higher treble a lot more). The battery is INSANE. I would go easily a week or more of daily use multiple hours a day without them even going to 10%. They also charge SUPER FAST, like it’s black magic fast. so that’s a big plus for these. finally, the microphone is pretty okay, it does the job and it sounds clear and cancels out wind and background noise on calls pretty wall. Overall, if you can grab these for under 320 USD, they are fantastic.","January 14, 2025","4.0","After owning them for a Year","sash","Color: Black","False"

Compared to any of these, the build quality of these headphones is simply subpar.While the sound quality is average—neither bad nor outstanding—the comfort is a major letdown.

They sound terrible out of the box, they NEED EQ from the Sound Connect app.Once EQ is dialed in, the sound is acceptable. The noise cancelling is where they really excel and why people likely love them so much. It is powerful and accurate.The one issue I'm having trouble with though is the headband. Especially if you're follically-challenged (bald) like me, the pressure of the narrow band can become quite problematic - even painful.The earcups are on the small/tight side and after extended use can also become uncomfortable; sweaty/warm. Not ideal. It's a shame.Sony needs to take a lesson from Beyerdynamic in headphone design. The bands need to be broader and padded and the earcups also need some more room to breathe, and at this price point should be made of a better material, not rubber and foam.These aren't $600 phones, but not cheap either.

For the life of me I could not find a more reasonably priced (and non-wireless) over hear headphone that had the lack of sound leak that I was looking for.-Sound quality seems good to me.-Wound up liking the wireless feature, even though that wasn't initially what I wanted when I started looking for headphones-The app offers some nice extra control-The tap/swipe controls on the headset itself are intuitive, and there aren't so many that it's confusing-These can also be used as wired headphones.-Seems to charge fast, and battery life seems good-They can connect to two devices-Fit well, and are lightweight, don't hurt my ears or head to wear for a long timeCons:-I kept bumping the outside of the headset because I often like to adjust them or lift them to itch my ears, etc, so I wound up eventually having to turn the tap/swipe feature off. If I was watching youtube, and accidentally bumped the outside of the earcup, then suddenly spotify starts playing while my youtube video is still going. It got too frustrating.-They feel a bit too flimsy, I'm worried I'm going to drop them or set them down too roughly, or something one day and easily break them. Luckily, I don't really plan to use them out, and only plan to use them at home for now.-When using wired, I feel like I still have to use up battery by keeping the noise cancelling feature on, because with it off it makes the sound quality too bad.-When using wired, it can't connect to the app, and bluetooth functionality is turned off.-When I turn on wireless and connect to the app, it automatically messes with my phone's media and ringer volumes, even if the device it is connecting to first after connecting to the app, is my computer. I keep my phone volumes all the way down 99% of the time, connecting these shoots the volume up, and I have to manually turn down. Have not found any solution in lots of searching.-Sometimes sound randomly cuts out if I have too many things open that have any audio. If I have a game open, that mutes its own audio when it is in the background, and I am trying to watch youtube, while also having spotify open, but the music paused and not playing...then the sound on youtube won't work. I have to close the game in the background in order to get the sound on youtube to work. I found when playing the game as well, that the sound kept cutting out ever few seconds. It does not do this when listening to spotify, even if I'm playing the game at the same time, and does not do this to other things like youtube if the game is closed. Maybe these are not good for gaming. I mostly listen to music so it's not terrible, but I do like to play games sometimes. They work fine for phone games, and for using wired on Switch.-I don't know if all colors would be like this, but the black is matte, so spots from oil from fingers show up so easily on it. Before even using them, and after having them just one hour I was already noticing them looking sort of messy from this, and it's a little unappealing lol. I'm not trying to impress anybody, so I don't really care, but looks-wise, it winds up making them look like $30 headphones, instead of nearly $300 headphones.","January 7, 2025","5.0","Seems great so far, if a little wonky in a few small areas","T","Color: Black","True"

Very clear and not “bass heavy” like my beats studio. For music-beats hands down. I got these for movies and tv. I wear hearing aids due to inability to understand speech. But sometimes sound reproduction with tv/movies is not good with the hearing aids. So now using these in place of when alone. For this purpose they do good. Speech is clear and sound stage is good. The thing i absolutely do not like is the controls, specifically the volume. There is no “on the fly” volume adjustment on headphones. It is tap and then tap, over and over and the adjustments seem to be 1% each time, so turning up or down takes a very long time. Using phone or ipad the volume control on them suffice. But with tv, tv volume control adjusts the headset volume at the same pace, so from 0 to 100 takes a solid 30 sec of pushing a volume button or continually swiping up. If using the app, there is an adjustment for everything possible!!! EXCEPT volume!!! Wth?!As for sound, clear mids and upper end, minimal distortion on low end. They are not head rattling loud or bassy, just loud enough to not hurt. If you want volume to deafen yourself, again beats!Noise canceling to be considered top of the line is mediocre. I notice no difference between my beats studio, air pods pro, or my pc gaming headset. It may decrease ambient noise 75%, but with a tv on in another room at vol 50%, i can still pick up a lot of what it is saying. So noise canceling/isolation-5/10.. clarity-9/10, bass-7/10, volume level-8/10. App-8/10- not very intuitive and lack of vol control. Design-9/10, comfort-10/10. Battery life-10/10. Charging cord-1/10, it is literally 3 inches long….Lastly, there is absolutely no instructions in package or app for touch controls, you will have to google all of it every time you want to use them if you cant remember.Would i buy again, at full price, no. On sale for what i paid, yes. At full price there are various options that do as well, easier function, as good or better noise cancelling, as comfortable, and most are cheaper.Also, bluetooth connecting again took a google search to see how to. Press and hold from power off the power button at least 5 seconds. It will power on, keep holding until you hear a second different sound/beep.","January 5, 2025","4.0","Good but with flaws","Chad","Color: Midnight Blue","True"

At this price point and sound quality, going cheap on materials for composition is a huge disappointment. Won’t be getting a 4th pair.

I got these while on sale and was super excited to try them.. One of the specs I was really excited for was the noise canceling feature (I can be sensitive to sound and get overwhelmed) but I wasn't really happy with it. I had to keep checking to see if it was actually on or not (it WAS on). It worked okay when having music on but I was just really surprised I could still hear as much as I could and was disappointed. Having no music playing while the ANC on was a big let down unfortunately.The sound quality is rely nice! I'll give it that. I've heard that Sony tends to have more bass forward headphones but I was left wanting more bass (to be fair I listen to a lot of EDM). As for as comfort, they aren't horrible but they did start to make my head hurt after wearing them for close or over 2 hours in one sitting.The quality feels nice, but I honestly don't think they are worth the money..I ended up returning them for the Sony ULTs and I love them compared to the XM5s.

Bose QC 45's came in a close second, the NC on them is killer (altho I'm sure the NC on the Ultra's is even better) but they are fantastic on the Sony too.  The 45's have a bassy edge which feels great because it's immersive, but the sound of the XM5, IMO...is fuller and richer than the Bose.  Listen to Live Erie by Zappa, Inca Roads; every sound on the stage distinct and crisp on both but the difference is in the ear: Bose immersion vs. the Sony clarity and I vote for the Sony.One thing: Am using my Xmas gift to swap XM5 renewed for a brand new one.

Great headphones for the money and intended use but no equalizer and noise cancelling is automatic and not that great.  I decided it was time for a set of premium noise canceling headphones, so I started researching.  I had it narrowed down to Sony, Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra and Apple Airpods Max.  Choosing Sony was fairly straightforward:  The Apple headphones are a lot more expensive and have no equalizer or sound enhancing software except for the EQ settings on your iPhone (forgot to mention I'm purchasing for use with iPhone/iPad).  The Bose have by far the best noise cancelling of the three, but the sound quality isn't quite up to par with the Sonys.  I decided incredible sound and great noise cancelling was more important than very good sound and perfect noise cancelling.  Plus the battery life of the Bose is significantly less than Sony.  I went with the blue color, thought it was a nice change from black.  I have a big head and big ears and the cups cover my ears completely and the fit is very comfortable.  Don't pair and try them before downloading the Sony app.  They sound a little flat out of the box with no enhancement.  Once I installed the app and spent about 30 minutes tweaking them to my liking, they were very impressive.  My best friend is a professional musician and has a set of very nice studio headphones.  These don't sound that good but they are very close.  Overall, I am completely satisfied with my choice.

The app provides customizable equalizer options so tht you can set the sound to your desired taste. However, one of the most important features that I really love is the fact that when noise canceling is turned off, there is absolutely no speaker hiss of any kind to speak of.Now there is a very slight hiss from the headphones when noise canceling is turned on, but that his is very minimal. However as an audiophile, I hate any kind of headphone hiss. It drives me absolutely nuts! But with these Sony headphones the hiss is barely there when the noise canceling feature is turned on. So it really doesn't bother me quite as much and I can still enjoy the rich digital sound that the headphones provide. I also love the 30 hour battery life as well as the quick charge feature too. Now I must let yo know that if you turn off both the noise canceling and the ambient sound functions, you'll get a much longer battery life from these headphones. That's because the noise canceling and the ambient sound modes do take up some of the battery life of the headphones while listening to them.//All in all, I give these a full 5 stars for sound quality and performance. When you use the bass boost feature on the app, these headphones provide extremely punchy bass that is sure to please anyone who loves a lot of bass in their music such as individuals who love listening to genres like EDM, and R&B. Sony has outdone themselves on this product and I urge anyone to get these headphones while they're still available.","December 24, 2024","5.0","Superb Sound Quality!","Donald Brown","Color: Black","False"

I am now adding a new requirements to my purchases: the manual/online support cannot use the term ""not a malfunction"" more than 10 times. Because oh boy do they seem to have a lot of issues to get ahead of.Now I am not going to act like i know how to fix these things or what a better product would look like, but I know when something is almost more trouble than it is worth. And this is unfortunately close to the later.First, you have to fix the audio source to what device you want to use from the mobile app. Otherwise it has a nasty habit of switching back and getting stuck on your mobile. Want to play games on your phone and listen to music on the PC? You can, but if it even tries to connect to your phone once it messes the audio up something fierce. So you have to disconnect it from your phone.But what if you want to just listen to music on your PC and not do anything with the phone? Well...it keeps doing the same thing. Sometimes it just switches the audio back to the phone. And often times when it does this, it sets the volume on my PC to 0 when switching back.If you are only connecting this to a mobile device than its fine. Everything else is where it just feels like it was close to being decent but not quite.Next issue, if i run my microwave from anywhere in the apartment--even on the other side of a wall--it freaks out. The crackling is so intense and irritating its unusable. Doesnt matter if i am in the living room meters away and through a wall, it finds a way to make it miserable.I have tried multiple settings to get this thing to behave and most of the time it works. But when it decides not to, it's best to just turn it off and try again later.I am the kind of person that turns off the bells and whistles first and then slowly turns them on as i get familiar with them to see what affects what. There are times the audio starts crackling despite being LDAC and having either connection or quality set to priority. The only thing that has worked when this happens is just giving up and using something else.On the plus side. The audio has been very good and when it works i can hear things far more clearly. It is actually been pretty good with work meetings as I have a hard time understanding my coworkers at times when they have thicker accents and mediocre mics. The voice eq on this paired with the noise cancellation has been good enough with meetings that I am going to keep it unless i find something better.Overall, its only slightly better than my M6 Pros.

I was excited about the better noise cancelling and microphones in this model, but I was worried about the portability and comfort of the new model.The noise cancelling is so good. It's kind of amazing how much sound this blocks out. I'm really happy with the sound in general.The diminished portability has not really been a big issue for me (the case is SO gigantic though--if you use these on the go a lot, you may not like them).I saw reviews complaining about how the headband is painful on this most recent model. Being a person blessed with a lot of hair, I hoped this wouldn't be an issue for me. It is. These headphones become very uncomfortable if you wear them for several hours a day.

I can understand them turning off to save battery but that’s not the case. They are NOT worth $350. Another weird design flaw is the way the earphones rest on your neck/shoulders when not being used. The cushy side doesn’t face down like other headphones. They angle at about a 45 degree which makes it weird when moving your head around. The part that goes over your head is too loose and adjusts too easily. I like the simple two buttons on the left side, one to turn on and off and the other to adjust the sound reduction. They are EXTREMELY clear and the bass is amazing. Bottom line is the fact that they don’t behave like one of the most expensive headsets out there. Turning off randomly, and after updates the sound reduction changing as it wants. They are not worth $350. 2 stars.","December 21, 2024","2.0","Randomly turning off","Tito","Color: Black","True"

JBL is great but I still wanted something better as I wear them a lot, and as a birthday gift to myself.First, I tried the Bose Quiet Comfort. The design was nice but the audio quality, comfort, plus mix control via the app, were all exactly the same as the JBL. The noise cancellation was also the same. I tested it and compared for a few days before reaching that result. It wasn’t worth the money, given the JBL are $80 vs the $200 discounted Bose (original price $349). Sure, the lilac Bose color was nicer, but it wasn’t worth a 100+ expense just for that.Figuring if I wanted better quality I needed to spend more, I got the Sony WH-1000XM5 for $298 (original price $399.99). The design was very nice but both sound and noise cancellation were the same as my JBL. On top of it all, I was only able to wear them for 40min as they started being incredibly uncomfortable on my ears. That was the ultimate deal breaker. For $300 I expected at least full comfort.I ended up returning both the Bose and the Sony. I was incredibly disappointed at how lacking these staple brands were when compared to the JBL. Needless to say I kept my original headphones.","December 19, 2024","1.0","Compared JBL with Bose with Sony","CJ","Color: Silver","True"

Sony is really good at maintaining the application tied to the headphone user and the fact that I've recieved a number of helpful updates since buying these headphones has been great. I use these everyday for casual gaming, studying, and going to the gym. I recommend being cautious when using these when you're sweating a lot at the gym due to the sensors having an affect on sweat. I've noticed that the detection system build into the headphones doesn't necessarily work anymore due to how often I've sweated while wearing these headphones. One annoyance that I have is the ""Speak to Chat Feature"" which keeps turning on whenever I talk at the gym. It might just be my headphones in particular but even if I go into the app and manually select to turn this feature off, it some how keeps coming back and turns itself on again. This is frustrating when you're in the middle of a set while exercising and then all of asudden the headphones pause the music and ambient mode is turned on. Regardless, amazing headphones and I'd recommend them for anyone. I was hesitant to buy these initially due to everyone stating they do not hold up well in the gym but they still function well enough for my liking!In the second photo I posted, you can see the slight stain marks caused by usage in the gym. If you want to avoid this, getting the black colored headphones might be recommended. However, I have been able to clean these stains out with a cleaning wipe. Plus, these headphones don't leave finger prints on the headphones which I know first hand that the black ones do (which was annoying hence why I got the white ones).","February 17, 2024","5.0","Amazing Quality Headphones","RyanRyan","Color: Silver","True"

It's so loud down here you can't concentrate and I'm tired of wearing gun hearing protection. A big thank you Sony thank you thank you thank you thank you again.

I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $20 back at the time in 2011 and now the quality they still continue to put out never disappoints! Here's the pros and cons of the Sony WH-1000XM5.Update: I also picked up the XM4 Earbuds from Sony and take note that those are on a different level for listening to music compared to the XM5 Over the Ear headphones. Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort. These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort. I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light. They weigh only about 0.56 pounds! People tend to have problems with headphones if they are heavy in my opinion! I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.Unique featuresNoise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion! It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be. They also tend to those who need to be aware of their surroundings by implementing a ambient mode like previous models. Works great and works like a charm by either taking the headphones off or covering the touch control panel. Also the Speak to Pause Music feature is insanely nice to have! Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.Superb sound!The sound quality out of these are amazing! Does really well in all areas of music genres. Particularly really in low frequencies for bass! I get to enjoy these at a great volume and it pairs amazingly with my PS5 as a gaming headset! (Will mention the headphones does not come with a microphone for gaming when using a headphone jack.) As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call! They are clear and surprisingly really balanced. The microphone on these headphones for phone calls are great. Better than the previous versions.Fast charging!The charging rate of these headphones is incredible! I never knew how fast charging can be with this! There's times I have left this powered on overnight as I'm at work for my 10 hour job and it was drained by the time I wanted to use it again. In those times I left it charging and goodness greatness these were ready to go in a about 10-15 minutes!  I enjoy these so much that I'm actually glad they have a 24-30 hour battery life.Cons:Cost.Its expensive! If you can get these on sale, it's worthwhile! If it's in your budget go for it! You pay for what you get in my opinion and these are worth their weight in gold!Fitment.They don't exactly fit around my short wide neck whenever I need to take it off and be present in a conversation or in my surroundings. Not exactly a big matter or deal breaker. More so it's a personal perspective. My neck size is 15 ¾ inches in circumference and that's pretty average I believe. I have to extend these in order to keep them around my neck without compromise. They also do not fold inward like the previous Sony headphone models but again never a issue.Cushion. Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on. I'm looking at other options to replace their soft fit leather design.Update: There is different earcups that you can replace the OEM cups with but it comes at a cost of I believe $60 which is worth noting.Conclusion.Worthiness of $350+ (price as of 12/07/2022) during the holidays? Yes!Personal opinionated review:Sony WH-1000XM5 or other leading competition? Sony, easily Sony. I've never been unhappy about this purchase and I tell people that Sony is industrial leading company that continues to impress people when it comes to their headphones. Beats by Dre(Apple), Apple and Bose has always been great by popularity but Sony gets appraised by quality!I will update this review as I go until they put a new model out.","November 24, 2022","5.0","Sony never disappoints!","Richard HuynhRichard Huynh","Color: Black","True"

I own Sony’s WH-1000 XM4s and the Bose 700s, two of the leading models in the industry. I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summer’s here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. It’s like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, “industry-leading noise cancellation.” And they ain’t lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that  - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. It’s pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, it’s like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You don’t have to do anything. It knows if you’re sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.No, noise reduction probably won’t completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. I’ve never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but they’ve improved the fit with a  new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you don’t want to hear.There were a few other design changes – the XM5s aren’t foldable like the XM4s, and there’s a redesigned case that’s collapsible to save room in your bag when you’re wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, you’ll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musk’s rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and you’re in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? That’s so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.But – how do they sound?Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. That’s important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably won’t have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass that’s necessary in most of today’s popular music.I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded “muddy” with some music. I didn’t notice that, but I’m a producer and I’m familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldn’t tell your boss about that.And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. They’re actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. I’ve made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldn’t tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things you’ll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!Oh – and there’s Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. That’s a pretty cool feature.So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If you’re moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so they’re probably worth looking into.

I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different. Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Personally, I prefer smooth, balanced, and LOW bass (down to 20Hz), but NOT boomy bass. I also like some sparkle in the highs (8k+).Initial impressions upon arrival and setup:- The packaging looks like it's a cheap recycled cardboard of some sort. Obviously doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- The zipable case the headphones live in also seem kinda cheap and flimsy. Again, it doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- Accessories are fairly light as it only comes with a stubby little 8"" long (seriously) USB charging cable (not even a wall adapter, just USB A to USB C) and a generic 1/8"" stereo headphone cable if you want to physically plug them into a headphone jack.- The app was easy to download, install, and update. It did require making a Sony account though, so points off for that.- Pairing the headphones to my phone and also my computer was quick and seamless. I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source. For example, the EQ curve I set on my phone was not active when I then paired the headphones to my laptop and listened to the same track.- Really needs more than 6 EQ points. Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).Listening impressions:- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).- Plenty of ""thump"" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).- Little bit ""dark"" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It's only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it's expected that imaging won't be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM's) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM's is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.- Minimal, but still present, ""pressure"" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with ""pressure"" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.","February 10, 2023","4.0","Not bad, but I expected a little better if I'm honest.","kcdkcd","Color: Black","True"

I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them. Fast bear on android is amazing, it works without any effort. The first time you turn it on or if you turn it on in pairing mode a picture of the headphones will pop up on a nearby android device and you just click connect, it is as simple as connecting air pods to an iPhone.Onto these headphones, they are exceptional. Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode. It no longer picks up background noise from fans and cars as much as it used to. Support for Spotify tap means you can launch Spotify, and have it pick up where you left off without even touching your phone.The new safe listening feature tells you if you are listening to music at unsafe levels for too long. It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.Sound quality is of course very good. Also, Sony's EQ is not the best, but for most people it is more than sufficient. If you like a bit more or less base you can adjust all of that very easily, and it comes with several presets.The issues:I have had three issues with my headphones so far. The first one was a strange bug where it identified to my phone as the FCC registered model number instead of as WH 1000 XM5 with a reset after a firmware update.The next issue is that I have not been able to get it to register with Google's find my device service, it is not a huge deal for me especially because I am less likely to leave the headphones somewhere that I am something smaller like earbuds, but it seems like that can be a bit hit or miss.The last issue is one that I alluded to earlier, and it is with the touch controls. These headphones do not have a physical Google assistant or any digital assistant button, instead you either say the wake word, or press and hold on the radio until you hear a tone. There is a strange bug when I tried to reply to a text that the Google assistant just read to me. It records my reply, but then says to push the Google assistant button to send or press and hold to record the message. You cannot push the Google assistant button, or you can do is press and hold which will just record the message so you cannot send your reply. However, this does not seem to be an issue when you just try to send a text, only when you reply so it is not the end of the world.Well, that ended up being longer than I thought it would. I hope someone has found this helpful because I just spent far too long writing it.","July 2, 2022","5.0","Simply amazing, and if you have the budget worth every penny","Nagisa11Nagisa11","Color: Black","True"

I've tested this on 3 separate PC's! If you want to wirelessly connect this to your PC via Bluetooth, hope whatever you're doing is worth stopping! 7 out of 10 times it just connects for a few seconds (no sound), then disconnects, and repeats forever till you LITERALLY RESET YOUR PC and hope it works this time. There's no way around it. I've tried unpairing it from the PC, resetting the headphones, updating the firmware of both devices.NOT ONLY THESE ISSUES but at COMPLETE random it'll decide to turn on ""Speak to Chat"" without ANY input or button presses from me. Having this option on means every time you speak, grunt, or hum, it'll drastically turn down the volume of the sound in your headphones for about 5 seconds, forcing you to stay as quiet as possible. The only way to turn this off is to go into the app and turn it off, EVERY time.""I no longer recommend this device. Sure, it works pretty well, but with all it's issues, if I had another choice that was equal, I'd pick something else.Edit after 5 months of use:Disconnects are more frequent, and at times it would suddenly lower the audio quality. The only way to fix it is to stop everything you're doing, turn it off, turn it on, and hope it reconnects. If I could, I'd get a refund. Either I have a defective model or it happens to everyone just not as frequent.**Edit after a month of use:Using Multi-device connection is very spotty, 3 out of 10 times the headphones will completely turn off without warning, even with a full battery. Noise cancelling is still very annoying, I'll hear all the sound around me till it decides to kick in and block some of it. With no way to adjust the amount of Noise Cancellation happening, the M3's I've been using has better blocking on some occasions. The issue with the band on the top is still just as bad, it genuinely hurts after long amounts of use. The only improvement from the M3 that I see is I can KIND OF sleep on my side with these on and they stay on my head better without sliding down.I still do no recommend this unless you plan on wearing it for short periods and in a quiet environment.**So this review is coming from someone who's worn the M3 Headset for over 4 years and I have to say, it's awful.I live in a place where there's sound in every direction. Dogs barking, kids screaming, everything you can think of, and ANC is a requirement for getting any work done.So the good:- Ear cups are comfortable, doesn't crush your head after long periods of time.- Sound is good, not absolutely amazing, but good. You need to download the Sony app to alter the sound to allow any bass to work, otherwise it'll sound static-y.- ANC is awesome but it's adaptive, which I don't like, but can be a plus for some. When it worked it blocked out almost every single sound.- The case design is cool, it has a little compartment inside that holds the charger cable and headphone jack.The bad:- I'm used to my M3's cancelling noise constantly, this device would adapt to the sound around you, letting sound bleed through before blocking it out after. Example: I was listening to a song at moderate volume, I could make any sound I want and I couldn't hear it. When the music had a break in volume, I could hear a LOT outside the headphones.- The head band that goes over your head is PAINFUL! It legit hurt after only an hour of use, it has almost NO padding and it was a thin plastic.- THE COLLAPSABLE CASE IS TERRIBLE! I unzipped the case to take the headphones out, I used them for a good 2 hours, put them back into the case, and when I went to open it again the zipper got stuck and it's IMPOSSIBLE to open now. Trust me, I got three separate people to try and open the case, they can't.I've been looking forward to a new ANC headphone brand, and I'm disappointed Sony didn't have someone wear these for more than an hour or try zipping and unzipping the bag more than a few times before going ""yep, let's send them out."".Sadly, I do no recommend these unless they are on sale and you DIY a comfortable way of wearing them for the top of your head. If they update the ANC and you want to work on making it not hurt the top of your head, they are decent, but not 400$ plus tax decent.The red circle on the picture shows a hole in the zipper, making it impossible to fully open.","May 22, 2022","1.0","Disappointing, painful *2023 Edit*","BunnyBunny","Color: Black","True"

I generally wait, do extensive research and try it myself before spending such a huge amount on any product. Sony has built a very strong brand for itself in the wireless headphone space since the launch of XM series. XM 3-4 both are great products, with no major issues. But they both had 1 or 2 drawbacks that didn't push be enough to upgrade and buy one.XM4 Bass is little forward for me. I like to prefer tighter, clear bass. XM5 delivers that.XM5 - the good Stuff1) ANC - Best ANC in the market. I own several Bose headphones and earbuds. This has far the best ANC.12 Quick setup- It took me not more than 5 mins to open the box, connect my phone and start listening. Battery was pre-charged to about 65%3) Comfortable - The earcup are soft padded with a faux leather type material that appears to be of good quality. Will have to see how it performs during sweaty, hot environment.4) Connectivity- It connect seamless, and quickly. The range is insane. I can literally walk all around in my home or in my backyard away from my phone and it stay connected. I have had no issue of any drop at all.5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.7) Multiple device connectivity8) Love the Sand (white) color9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing. The default EQ out of the box is really good. But if you customize the EQ and bump little bit the Clear bass and treble it just sounds amazing.It's been 6 hours non-stop listening for me, I have played all kind of genre and they all sound great.XM5-Not so good1) Carrying Case - Case is little big, flatter. The headphone doesn't fold. Not a huge deal, but it could be issue for some.2) It can get hot after couple of hours.To sum it up, for 4hunderd bucks, it is not a cheap headphone. But does it deserve the price tag and delivers on that. YES! With all the features it has, I really do not find anything that I am going to be missing or need for at least several years. It even has a 3.5mm jack :)This will be my new travelling buddy as I prepare to start travelling again!","May 20, 2022","5.0","Best ANC - that Sounds great, Comfortable and Great Connectivity","LyricSpring77LyricSpring77","Color: Silver","True"

In my opinion the frequency response is very good.I am concerned about durability of the hinges. In my case the left hinge seems wobbly and the gap is slightly more than the right side. I baby of my electronic devices, but the hinges of XM5 worry me and they don’t feel sturdy at all.I also suggest buying XM5s directly from Sony or any other authorized seller except amazon.

I was disappointed with the fit of the previous model as they did not fully cover my ears and became uncomfortable after an hour of wearing. The 5th Gen are lighter and seem to fit better. I've worn them constantly since buying them and they feel good.To really get the full benefit of these headphones you need to be prepared to install Sony's Headphone app which opens up more settings. The noise cancelation is exceptional. I can barely hear anything around me when it's turned on full. I also don't get any vacuum sensation or high pitched frequency noise when NC is on which is a huge plus. The audio quality is really well balanced for my ears and taste in music. The bass is there, but not too dominant, mids are clear and the highs are crisp without being tinny. I love that the sensors pause audio when I remove the headphones and resumes when I wear them again. They also effortlessly switch between my Samsung phone and Samsung tablet without any hassle.The only minor gripe I have is with the new design carrying case. It's not as small or robust as previous generations and feels quite flimsy. I guess I'll see how well it holds up over the coming weeks. As before a USB type C charging cable is included along with 3.5mm jack for wired audio.

These headphones can be easily driven wirelessly or with a 3.5mm wire without any problems. I personally pre-amp them to -24.5db, and they still produce sufficient volume.

I still am impressed by the otherwise excellent performance, however i am getting an exchange and will update again soon.Edit 2: Replacement unit has no audible issues. However i have noticed that after a very short amount of time the pads deform permanently. This is likely due to the (probably) low density foam used, and could be detrimental to sound quality in the long term.Edit 3: Accidentally put a little too much force when squeezing these into a bag, the bracket held to the band by a single screw and some adhesive kinda just fell apart. Pushed it back together but there's a small gap there now. Maybe this headband isn't so well built.Edit 4: Returned under RMA. ANC clips too easily and the build is not good enough to use long term.

I've been satisfied with the XM5s in all ways but noise-canceling and Sony seem to have done their best to chase the rep of Apple's noise-canceling solution to their own detriment due to a MUCH worse implementation of auto noise canceling.Unlike the 1000XM3s and XM4s, the XM5s no longer allow you to run the optimizer to adjust your noise-canceling yourself but instead opt for the poor ANC (auto noise canceling) to be the ONLY method of adjusting the noise-canceling level. I currently work from home and have ADHD which makes subtle noises and even basic conversation not relevant to what I'm working on a huge issue for my focus. I relied on my XM3s to provide the proper noise canceling (with or without music) that I needed to avoid distractions but the XM5s ANC solution can't hold a candle to the experience of just manually adjusting the noise-canceling yourself via the optimizer in the XM3s.I can hear almost everything while they're on. It drowns out small annoyances like buzzes and hums from electronics but its effect on voices and sounds around the same decibel level as a casual conversation and above seems to be around 50% effective. I can still hear the typing of my keyboard, loud sounds outside, the TV show someone's watching down the hall, people talking around me, almost everything! I bought these and brought them with me as my main pair while traveling away from home and can't really work well due to the amount of noise that seeps through them.I'm sure they're great for plane or car rides or traveling close to traffic but if you wanted a pair of noise-canceling headphones for every situation and not just the extremes that finally trigger the noise canceling on them just get a pair of Airpods Max. When I return these that's what I'm doing!","June 3, 2022","2.0","Poor Noise Canceling And No Way To Control It","AsaAsa","Color: Black","True"

The mic quality and noise cancellation were especially impressive. Unfortunately the new design has two major design flaws.1. Wear detectionWear detection was a new feature for me. It automatically pauses anything that's playing when you take the headphones off and resumes when you put them back on. Sony used a new wear detection sensor that's installed under a layer of fabric and foam in the ear cup. It worked great at first, but then it quit detecting anything after a few months. I tried cleaning the fabric but no dice. Now the headphones won't automatically turn off even if it isn't connected to any devices like my XM3s. Annoying, but I could live with it.2. HeadbandThe headband on the XM5 is pretty thin. It's still comfortable to wear but it has a weak point that's prone to breaking as you can see in other reviews. Happened just after my warranty expired too. Lucky me. Sony doesn't sell a replacement part so I can't use my headphones any more. Meanwhile my 5 year old XM3s are still going strong.It sucks because I was really happy with the XM5s. Until Sony fixes the design flaws they just aren't worth the money.","August 24, 2023","1.0","Great headphones, bad design","glamazon22glamazon22","Color: Silver","True"

That said, I consider these to be good for these reasons:A: Exceptional battery life.B: Call quality that was considered good UNTIL I did a direct comparison to my Blueparrott B450-XT’s -  NO WHERE NEAR the quality of the Blue 450’s, BUT the Blues are made specifically for calls in noisey environments. . Blues are in my opionion the defacto standard by which all other ANC phone calls should be judged. My ""demo"" for people is to run my upright vacuum cleaner whilst on a call.  People on the other end cannot hear it AT ALL – REALLY!, I hear them, and they hear me perfectly! TRULY amazing!  I did the same test with these and alas they failed miserably in comparison.  I expected that. I was told they sound like I am in a room away from the microphone, a bit fishtank like, and muddy. SO, they’ll do in a call but not as a primary phone call device in noise.  I heard a sample of the BOSE 700’s and they were terrible, which is what prompted me to get the Sony’s.C:  One unconventional thing they do great at: A Sleep Aid. Yup, they drown out all the extraneous noises like people talking, Air conditioners, fans, Water coolers, hums, etc.  ALL gone with nothing playing through them!I bought them primarily for playing on my PS5, and watching TV late at night. They do both quite well.D: Amazingly, my ears do not sweat much in these even after prolonged use.  I’ve ordered those Dekoni Suede Earpads for them as well just for added comfort.(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS4T3X62?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)(5/16/23 - Returned The earpads: they claim they are suede when in fact they are 2/3 suede. The inner part inside the cup is something else, not leather so NOT durable. Considering this, $49 seems FAR too expensive.)E:  They are long-term comfortable unless you have ears like a B-52 in which case you will probably be stuffing bits.As for music, I find them to be more flat without pronounced highs or bass - which I prefer.  The  EQ on the app is a nice feature. The ANC works very well listening to music and will be adequate to the task in both quiet and noisey settings.  Again, I remind you, I’m not 18. ;-)Pricewise, they ARE a bit expensive but the build quality seems better than most.If you have the time, I would HIGHLY recommend you test several brands and models at a store simply because sound quality is subjective and EVERYONE has their preference.UPDATE: 5/23/23 - Returning (REPLACING) Headphones - Why?  They started acting ""Funky"".  By that, I mean that if you turn them off, they will not turn on unless you do not hit any buttons for about 15 sec. NOT normal.  ALSO, they started to exhibit Connection issues that were NOT there initially.  I STILL, at this point consider them excelllent. Now, if the NEW pair goes weird, THEN I would have to re-evaluate.UPDATE 6-3-23:  New pair are working as they should no connection issues or on/off bttun problems.UPDATE 2-16-24: Still working perfectly and I use them nearly every night to sleep.","May 4, 2023","5.0","Are you Older?

I had held off this purchase, thinking that by now Sony would've released the XM6 by now. But no, Sony decided to continue making and selling the XM5. Tired of any further waiting for something that might not happen anytime soon, I finally caved and bought the XM5 when Amazon put the price back under $300 for the October 2024 Amazon Days.The first thing I noted was how CHEAP the packaging and the accompanying accessories were for this XM5. No stout carrying/storage case this time around. The headphone's boxed packaging might appear to be about Sony trying to be environmentally conscious and being ""green"", but I suspect that Sony was more about SAVING some green by cheapening up their packaging costs. Even at a discount price, the rudimentary unboxing process made me feel a bit cheated.However after charging up the XM5, I have to admit that in the end it's really only about the user experience with the headphones. And I must confess that it's pretty great, a definite step forward from the XM3 from two generations before. The XM5 is definitely more comfortable for me than the XM3, which itself wasn't all that bad to begin with. I still loathe the swipe controls on the right earpad, but at least I god used to them during my years of using the XM3.I have six plus decade old ears, so a LOT of the sonic range is now denied to my brain as my ears certainly don't perform like they used to. But I still can hear enough to say that acoustically the XM5 is a noticeable step forward from the old XM3. While initially the XM5 sound seemed a little colder and a bit on the sharp side, the soundstage imaging is better and more appealing to me, and detail recreation seems marginally improved over the older headphones. So far well-recorded live performances sound a bit more spatially realistic than what was possible with the XM3, and as the burn-in hours add up (roughly about 120 hours of burn-in so far), I suspect that these nuances with further blend, warm up and smooth out.I don't generally use over-ear wireless headphones for phone calls, so I can't really comment about this feature set of the XM5 when I used it with my cellphone. It does seem to work okay, and persons on the other end seem to regularly claim that they can hear me well enough.All in all I'm pleased with the XM5 so far. It sounds nicer than the retiring XM3 I had been using, and it fits my large noggin decently well. I do think that the headband is, if anything, a bit on the loose side. But that does seem to aid in making the XM5 wear as comfortably as it does for me. The XM3 was a difficult set to wear to sleep; any slight turn of my head at night often resulted in neck pain the next morning. I've not had this problem at all with the XM5. So far it's been a 5-star experience, and I'm looking forward to continuing to use these for the next few years.","October 25, 2024","5.0","Comfortable and great-sounding","monoblocks","Color: Midnight Blue","True"

Its sound is excellent, and its soundstage is good as they claim. However, its microphone was not as good as I had hoped.Fast-forward to 2024, the Sony WH1000MX7 was on sale for nearly 50% off the original MSRP. Of all of the Bluetooth headphones with ANC, it was consistently rated the best or runner-up. Notably, its microphone was well-regarded.I bought one, refurbished like new.I will compare these two as they were contemporaries and direct competitors.My general use cases consist of listening to music while I work, participating in a virtual meeting, and talking on the phone while I do chores around the home.Music on the Bowers and Wilkins is where the headphones shine. The Px7 S2 was reported to have a very neutral sound out of the box. I found that to be very true. Its soundstage magic and clarity of drivers gave each part of the music very good separation.I listened to the Jurassic Park theme song from years ago — don’t judge. It is orchestral with many instruments contributing to the detailed delight of sound. I use this track to sound-check every new pair of headphones I get, so this would have been the sixth or seventh pair of headphones I used to listen to that theme song. For the first time, I heard two or three instruments whereas before I thought there was only one.How did the Sony’s do? They were pristine headphones, but they couldn’t achieve that level of detail and separation.Out of the box, the Sony headphones are said to be a bit bass-heavy. However, the customization feature of the app allowed me to tune the bass to my preferences.Sony partially compensates with its app and five-channel equalizer, but it could not better B&W’s music-playing prowess.For the second challenge, the Px7 S2’s were wasted on video conferencing calls. Yes, my managers never sounded so life-like except when they were in person. My tuned Sony cans were more than capable of reproducing their sound. Sony wins this round, because my colleagues described me as sounding more loud with my Sony’s.And in the final challenge, I switched between the two headphones while taking telephone calls. For the most part, the Px7 S2’s was overqualified in sound production. Background sounds on my end were also filtered out by the mic, except on two occasions when I got ice from my ice dispenser and ripped open a package at chest height. Meanwhile, the Sony sounded just fine, but the ice dispenser was not so annoying at the other end.Other notes:The Px7 S2 has a physical button to toggle on-off. It’s a quick flip of the switch, and within seconds it is connected and ready to go.The Sony’s power button is a press-and-hold button. It’s a little more annoying, because if you hold it too long, it does something else. It takes just as long to get connected.Gone are the days I tell my conversation partner to wait while I get bluetooth connected and have to put on elevator music for them.Of the two designs, I prefer Bowers and Wilkins’s.The Sony headphones rely mostly on touch controls. Although all manner of functions can be done via touch, I can’t remember which gesture does what. The Px7 S2 uses physical buttons for volume control, play/pause, and connect and disconnect. Once more, I prefer the physical controls.Finally, the B&W headphones are noticeably heavier than the Sony ones. If you’re sitting and staying still, the extra weight doesn’t matter. On the other hand, if you’re up and about and turning your head often, the Sony’s feel much more planted on the head. The Sony’s are generally regarded as having better ANC. In my experience around the house, they’re very close. It still surprises me which sounds get through ANC and which don’t. With enough happening around you, the Sony’s seem to block more sound.You can’t go wrong with either pair of headphones. It’s very much up to your preferences. If you like strawberry — I don’t know — go with one of them. If you prefer chocolate, then go with the other one, I’d say.Ok fine. If you want a more feature-filled app or better EQ or better mic or lighter weight => Sony.Sound or materials and style => B&W.How about that?","August 7, 2024","5.0","Like wearing technology","Chicken Little","Color: Black","True"

Before dialing in the EQ, they're very average and even a little muddy; definitely not worth $400 imho. They also creak ENDLESSLY while wearing glasses (not necessarily the fault of Sony but it did happen, it did annoy me, and I did return it for that reason). They sound very compatible to Bose 700s. If you choose to buy these, absolutely wait until they're $250 or less.About me: I am an amateur audiophile. I have 20 years experience being fussy about the sound that comes out of audio devices. It has to be at least good. I can't stand it when you're listening to something and it's muddy or obfuscated or doesn't give you the full sound because of inadequacies of the device. That being said, I don't know all the audio-related terms or specs and I am not an audio engineer.I read a ton of reviews and watched a ton of YouTube videos (especially from This is Tech Today) about these headphones. I am a longtime Bose fan, starting with the QC 15s, then the 35s, 35iis, and now the 700s. I used the 700s for almost 2 years before I started itching to know what else was out there. I came across This is Tech Today's multiple videos showcasing the sound of industry leading headphones, and I was horrified by how flat and awful the Bose sounded. Clearly I was missing out on a LOT.Price and feel----I bought these Sony XM5s at full price (long story, don't recommend it). My first impression after receiving them is that they certainly didn't feel like $400 headphones. MAYBE $200, but that's a tough maybe. The material is very light and eco-plasticky. They feel like that plastic that's designed to be biodegradable (I don't know if they are; that's just what it feels like). I was prepared for that based on others' reviews, so I didn't hold that against them initially.Comfort----When I first put them on, they were comfortable enough. After long wear sessions with my Bose 700s, I found the band to be a little uncomfortable on the very top of my head and I was worried these would be similar with the same form factor, but they're light enough that they are comfortable for long periods.Sound----At first, the sound was disappointing. Like all of you, I have certain songs I use to test sound from various devices and this was not giving me the full effect of these songs. I went to the internet for some EQ recommendations specific to the XM5s and this made a HUGE difference. They sounded pretty good.I no longer had my Bose 700s at this point (sold them to purchase these because I'm not made of money), but I used my partner's Bose QC35ii to test against. I didn't realize this until I went to test, but the Bose 35ii don't have an EQ setting in the Bose app. You get what you get. And what I got sounded VERY comparable to the EQ-adjusted XM5s. I spent a solid hour listening to the same test songs over and over with both, and while the Sonys come out just a little bit ahead, it's not a difference you're going to notice if you aren't directly comparing the two side by side. I wouldn't even miss it knowing about the difference if I had to use the QC35ii.Sony app----This app looks like it's from 2005. It's a little painful to use. I could learn to live with it, and it does what you need it to do, but it certainly isn't an easy or enjoyable app to use as of June 2023.The creaking----This is what did it for me. I wear glasses. I also wear headphones/a headset for 8 hours a day for work, and then another few hours for gaming in the evening. Without glasses, these creaked ever so slightly once in a great while. They're made of plastic so it's going to happen, and I could live with that. However, once I put on my glasses, the cushions against my frames creaked when I breathed. Or blinked. And if I turned my head, good lord the creaking. It was all I could hear, even while listening to music at inadvisably loud volumes.The verdict----I returned these and re-purchased the Bose 700s and I couldn't be happier.Again, I'm no audio engineer. I'm not claiming to be. But for me and my use cases, and my personal opinion on the value for money, I'm giving my money to Bose. I get more for less.","June 27, 2023","3.0","Went back to my Bose 700s","Abby","Color: Silver","True"

I use these most of every day at home, switching between work calls, music, podcasts, gaming, and videos. I use it with bluetooth and on 3.5mm, on half a dozen or so different devices.Noise cancelling is noticeably improved, and seems to ramp up or down in intensity based on the volume around you, which is nice when a truck or something goes by and it needs to amp it up, but bring it back down to ""i just have a window fan on"" levels after.Bluetooth is a lot better. The XM3 had issues where it needed 10-30sec to connect to things, it often chose the wrong devices to connect to, and worked best if you kept it exclusive to a single transmitter. This switches connections quickly, it seems to prefer connecting to the last device you connected to (not just whichever one is around), and it doesn't have the same delays before it plays sound.Small note, the system noises changing from a lady yelling ""POWER ON"" and ""POWER OFF"" and ""BLUETOOTH CONNECTED"" to little guitar strums, is very nice. The lady's voice is still present when saying battery levels or pairing, but you never hear it unless you're specifically trying to, much more comfortable.If you see people complaining about sound quality, it's probably because they hooked it into a 3.5mm jack and didn't turn it on. Quality's abysmal without power. But with the cord plugged in and the power on, works as well as with bluetooth, and on par with any other headsets. If you're an audiophile, get some studio cans or some Swiss abomination with hand-wound resistors or something. If you don't know what ""dynamic range"" is, then these will be great and on par with any other headphones you'll get.","December 10, 2024","5.0","Good upgrade from XM3","Knetic","Color: Black","True"

I would consider myself a mild audiophile (I have a DAC, AMP, and too many headphones). With that said, everyone's ears are different so take this with an extra pinch of salt.Out of the box experience:  The packaging was quite nice. It included a hard-shell carrying case, USB-C to USB-A charging cable, 1.2m long 3.5mm cable, and the headphones. The connection process for new devices is wonky and leaves a bit to be desired. The initial pairing did not work until I installed the Sony Headphones Connect app from the appstore. After this, you have to power off the device then power on and hold the power button for 5 seconds to enter pairing mode (confirmed by a vocal ""pairing"" from the headphones).  The sound signature left a lot to be desired. For a bit of background, my favourite type of headphone is flat/neutral with a balanced sound signature. I enjoy heavy bass in electronic music and am sensitive to loud highs/mids (I get listener fatigue quite fast from it). I enjoy a lot of variety when listening to music an will try most things out. In particular I regularly listen to Classical, Avant-garde, Experimental, Easy listening, Electronic, Contemporary folk, Latin, Jazz, Rock, and some Traditional folk. I don't tend to listen to much Blues, Rap, or Hip Hop. I occasionally listen to mainstream-Pop and Country.Without EQ, the sound signature is very very dark. The bass is very punchy and present, the mids are recessed, and the highs have their edge taken off. I was not a fan of it for anything but electronic tracks with no vocals and heavy bass. Even then, it wasn't particularly amazing. Anything with vocals will sound horrendous (again, with no EQ) as the bass frequencies in voices will be very pronounced.  The ANC worked well for me out of the box. For the open mode, I set it to let near voices through and ambient noise out. I use them with eyeglasses but the ANC still seems to work well. They do a particularly good job of filtering out A/C noises, the electronic whine that appliances generate (not all people can hear this), and running water. The ANC tends to struggle with erratic high pitched noises (as I understand it, most ANC systems do). However, it will dull the noise a tad through both the closed back headphone and ANC component.Adaptations  Since I was not a fan of the sound profile out of the box, I set up an EQ profile with these headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect app includes an EQ but I found it to be extremely limited in terms of customisability (I did not like any of the presets that were offered) and not very user friendly. Due to this, I set up my own external EQ using AutoEq (on github) as a starting point. After fine tuning it to my preferences, using the headphones became a much much better experience.  They sound very good for Bluetooth headphones. For genres where I like more bass, I strongly prefer the Sony headphones over my Sennheiser and prefer the Sony to my Bose.  In wired mode, the headphones definitely sound better but no where near as good as my other wired headphones. If I'm attached to a wire, I would rather just switch to another pair of headphones. With that said, they do sound better if you leave the headphones on while connected with a cable.  The ANC works well for me. If I use them for noise canceling without music, it can get unsettlingly quiet in the mornings (which is a great thing). Around others, particularly in the kitchen, the headphones do a very good job of dulling and eliminating noises. The pass through function works well in the event of conversation. I am a very quiet eater but these headphones did a great job canceling out all noises while I ate. I don't use these headphones outside, so I do not know how well they perform with nature's noises.  The gesture controls included are useful but a bit too involved to be my go to. If I have physical access to my device, I prefer to use that to control the music. However, the pause on take off feature is amazing! It consistently pauses my media any time I have to take my headphones off and resumes right where it left off and soon as I put it on. Simply magic is the only way I have to explain it (the function can be turned off if you don't like/want it).","March 26, 2023","4.0","Review After 2 Months","Andrew","Color: Black","True"

I do not recommend purchasing these headphones, as there are many similarly priced alternatives that offer nearly the same benefits as these headphones without the drawbacks.I really wanted to love these headphones. At first I liked them and figured I'd warm up to them even more, but there have been too many issues. Due to the below, I do not think I will purchase more headphones from Sony, and I'm certain my next purchase for headphones will be from Bose, as I've always had positive experiences with their products.Note that I have already checked, and both the headphones firmware as well as the official 'Headphones' app are fully up-to-date ('Headphones' app version 10.4.2 at the time of writing). Also, the issues I lay out below have persisted for many weeks throughout daily use, persisting beyond many restarts of the headphones as well as restarts of every single device I've ever connected them to.Pros:Great sound. I'm no audiophile, but I think the sound is really good and at least on par with what I experienced with my Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones.ANC is great. I don't know if I think it's better or worse than my other headphones, but I think it's great. However, there is an ANC-related problem that I mention below.The 'Speak-to-Chat' and 'Adaptive Sound Control' are neat features. In most situations I always keep them off because I don't need them, but occasionally I do need them and I think they're nice to have. However, there is an issue with 'Speak to Chat' that I bring up below.Battery life seems great. I haven't done testing specifically, but they last many hours, most likely meeting or exceeding the description of 24+ hours of use between charges.Cons:When connected to two devices simultaneously, these headphones consistently send play/pause commands incorrectly. Here's a good example, though this has happened in many other contexts. Frequently I have the headphones connected to my cell phone and one other device, usually my laptop. If I happen to use standard speech-to-text on my cell phone, the headphones will send a play/pause command to my laptop. This means on my phone I will begin to use speech-to-text, and then whatever audio or video was playing last on my laptop will start playing. This has happened many, many times over weeks.The ANC automatically reduces frequently when I speak out loud. Probably anyone familiar with this product will immediately want to say that I need to disable the headphones' 'Speak-to-Chat' feature, since that's what that feature is for, and of course that feature is also toggleable. However, when this happens I check to be certain that 'Speak-to-Chat' is off, and I see that it was already off as I had set it previously, and yet still if I speak out loud, I can hear a very clear, unambiguous change to ANC, as more ambient sound becomes audible to me. Adjusting configurations relevant to this in the official app does not help.As far as I've been able to tell, if you want to force the headphones into pairing mode, you must fully power them off and then turn them back on, pressing and holding the power button while turning them back on until they enter pairing mode and give an audible alert. If I attempt to press and hold the power button when the headphones are already on in order to enter pairing mode, the headphones simply power off. I do not think I should have to turn them all the way off just to put them into pairing mode like this. I have been unable to put them into pairing mode unless I turn them all the way off and back on, which should be unnecessary.Cons (personal preference):I do not like the touch controls as opposed to using physical control buttons. I already knew that these headphones use touch controls when I ordered them, and I simply hoped that they would work well for me even though I prefer buttons. Unfortunately usually a couple of times a day I end up accidentally bumping them and skipping forward or backward on whatever I'm listening to; this of course never happens when I use headphones with physical buttons for controls.I do not think these are comfortable; in my opinion they are just tolerable. I wear my headphones for extended periods of time, and while I do not think they've ever caused pain, I do find them to be uncomfortable on my ears eventually. Of course, this is subjective as someone with ears shaped differently or a slightly differently shaped head may find these to be perfectly comfortable.I would really like it if these could be folded up or collapsed to make them easier for storage, but this is a minor point.I want to like these. I really do. But almost every single day I experience multiple frustrations with them that I never had with headphones from other manufacturers. I've reached the point that I would rather use older, lower quality headphones than these. I would rather use other headphones, even if I will have a poorer audio experience and lose out on some features, as long as it means I no longer have to deal with the frustrations I mentioned above.","September 15, 2024","2.0","I wanted to love these...","Matt Skaggs","Color: Black","True"

I really wanted to write a rave review on them. Unfortunately I've also had a series of horrible problems that make them impossible to recommend.I'll start with the good. 1) These have the best ANC (active noise cancellation) on the consumer market right now. I also have Airpods Max and have compared with a freind's top of the line Bose QC Ultra. These put both to shame when it comes to ANC. It's incredible. Like so good it's almost dangerous.... I kinda worry I wouldn't hear a fire alarm going off while listening to music with these lol. I should note though, that to get this ANC performance you have to make sure there's nothing between the earpads and your head, like a hat or bunched up hair. My metal framed glasses don't make a difference, but my chunkier plastic frames let a bit more noise through  2) The battery life is amazing. I've been getting 24-28 hours of use with ANC on for each charge. They also charge fast - for me it's typically 45 minutes to go from zero to fully charged. For fast charging you do need a quality USB-C cable (I use Anker cables - they're excellent and very affordable). When I used a cheap crappy cable it took over 2 hours. 3) They're incredibly light-weight and very comfortable. I almost forget I'm wearing them. The ergonomics make them feel like they're custom made for my head and the ear pads and head band are the softest I've ever felt on headphones. The build is pretty plasticky, but they still feel well made / durable... and I think it's worth it for the weight reduction it allows. 4) Like any Bluetooth noise canceling headphones you're not getting hi-fi audio quality, but its better than most other bluetooth headphones. It's not as good as Airpods Max, but better than Bose and any of the cheaper bluetooth headphones I've tried. The most notable weakness is some muddiness in the lower frequencies, in my experience. 5) The case it comes with is awesome. It's a bit bulky, but it keeps the headphones very well protected and has a small compartment that you can keep a charging cable or 3.5mm audio cable in (which you can use for a wired connection if the battery dies, if the device you're using has a headphone jack). It's also very nice aesthetically. Overall the case puts Apple's Airpods Max case to absolute shame - that one barely covers half of the headphones, so it's worthless for protection. I'd honestly throw it away, but Apple is a dick and decided to make it so the headphones are always on and using battery unless you put them in their crappy case. 6) If you download the mobile app, there are tons of options to customize your experience. You can change the EQ, turn speak-to-chat on/off (disables ANC when it detects you're speaking to someone), choose your priority between sound quality vs. stable bluetooth connection, allow to connect to 2 devices simultaneously, integrate Siri or Amazon Alexa, customize controls, and a bunch of other things.Okay, now the problems. 1) A week after I bought them the speaker in the right ear started randomly making a loud buzzing/popping noise periodically. It's not all the time, but pretty frequent and very annoying. It happens for about 30 seconds a few times every hour of use. Sony claims it happens in places where ultrasonic waves are used to eliminate rodents and suggests you turn off ANC to prevent it... which is aggravating. ANC is the only thing that makes these worth such a high price tag and Sony is the only brand with that problem. Also, I'm 90% sure their explanation doesn't even apply to my environment. 2) Just two weeks after I bought them the touch controls started FREAKING OUT, detecting gestures when I wasn't even touching them. It rapidly flips between playing and pausing my music, skip songs, flip between enabling/disabling voice-to-chat, etc. all on its own, making them entirely unusable when that happens. It happens every hour or two, and once it starts it continues until I turn them off and back on. When I contacted Sony about this, they advised me to just disable gesture controls in the app. That prevents it from pausing or skipping my music, but it does not turn off the pinging sound the headphones make when a a tap/gesture id detected, so you still hear rapid random pinging  whenever it decides to bug out. SUPER annoying. 3) 4 weeks after I bought them they just turned off on their own suddenly 10 minutes after I finished charging them to 100% and would not turn back on. I tried a factory reset and they still wouldn't turn on. after repeatedly trying to turn them on, they finally did... for a second, but shut down right after connecting them to my device. I figured they were completely busted, but when I tried again a few hours later they started working again and were fine for a few day... then it happened again. No idea what the deal is, but it's happened 4 times now, so I need to send to Sony to see if they'll fix them. Based on past experience trying to use Sony's warranty for repairs on other products though, they're probably going to send them right back and claim nothing is wrong because it didn't happen during their 30-second inspection.To summarize, these are SO CLOSE to being the best wireless ANC headphones to buy right now IMO. I really love them when they work... whenever I have to use my much more expensive Airpods Max, they make me wish I were using the XM5s minus all the issues. When they work, I prefer almost everything about the XM5 over the airpods. Unfortunately they're ruined by a few really bad problems. I would recommend getting the WH-1000XM4 instead. They have the same noise cancelling performance and most of the other great qualities and haven't been plagued with bugs. They're slightly less comfortable, but the tighter fit makes them more secure, which can be a benefit for people who want to wear them while working out.","December 16, 2023","2.0","These had so much potential...","GarthVader","Color: Black","True"

I have had many, many ear buds over the years and only a few over the ear headphones, and those were Grado open head sets.The Isolation these offer is impressive by itself, however if you wear glasses (or sungasses), it's totally ruined. But without glasses and with the noise cancellation, it was really impressive how good nice an peaceful my flight home was.l could I still hear the baby a couple rows back? yes I could but not if I has some loud music playing and it was fairly unintrusive even without the music and listening to an audiobook. If you want a snack or a drink you better be paying attention, cause you're not going to hear the flight attendant. The engine drone was basically gone, and if I really wanted some isolation I could comfortably wear my noise canceling earbuds under the noise cancelling headphones, that's when the world really goes away (I know, overkill, but my OCD made me try, worth it, but the sound was probably better from the sony's than my liberty 4's but silence is always nice too, especially when you know you’re in a loud environment)It's a tough call when you can get such great results from headphones a third of the price, but It was nice to know what the top of the line can do, and as impressive as it is, for me I'd rather wear a single bud most days to talk on the phone or listen to an audiobook in bed, large headphones just aren't the most practical option for that.However I will keep them for flights and for listening to music when I want the quality to be amazing. Flying has gotten so bad, that having your own space even if that space is just peace and quiet and being able to ignore everything else going on around you, it's well woth the price of admission.","October 11, 2024","5.0","Impressive sound quality and noise canceling","DaltonC","Color: Black","True"

Are they bad headphones? No. Are they worth the money? No, not even on sale lol. I returned mine and bought the Sony WH-1000XM4, and here's why:**Noise Cancellation (6/10): This feature was ok at best. The Apple AirPods Max are still top of the line for noise cancellation - I hear nothing when I wear them. With the Sony WH-1000XM5, I can still hear a lot of sounds around me. I'd say it cuts out maybe 60-70% of noise. My biggest issue here was that the noise cancellation would turn off randomly - so I would have to manually turn on/off the noise cancellation and ambient noise, which was just irritating.**Sound Quality (7/10): Sound quality was fine, it was nothing exceptional. The first day I received them, something really weird happened and the sound went completely muffled - like I was underwater. I looked up the issue and there have been similar issues for other customers who bought these headphones. The sounds went back to normal the next day, but I was already skeptical about their performance.**Comfort (9/10): I think they were really comfortable. I wear plastic framed glasses, so headphones that work with them can be a mission. The Apple AirPods Max do not work with my glasses at all, they pinch my frames and move them around - I need to wear contacts with them. With the Sony WH-1000XM5, this really isn't an issue. I needed to adjust my glasses every once in a while, but maybe once in like 3 hours. I think they're one of the best fitting headphones for people with glasses. Also, when I went to adjust the headband portion to make them shorter/tighter, they would slip - they just would not stay adjusted to where I needed them (this could be because I bought them slightly used, so it could have just been from previous wear - but still an issue if they become loose over time).**Product Quality (6/10): The headphones themselves are cheap plastic and just feel flimsy. For almost $400, you would expect them to feel a little better or more sturdy. I was constantly worried I was going to break them. The case is nice and hard, and I personally think they store nicely and are easy to travel around with. I bought the beige ones (again, I bought them slightly used), but the case was dirty and it stains easily since it's made of cloth material. The foam on the ear part is very soft, so it's kind of just your preference there. I think they felt a little cheap, but I also think that they added to the comfort.**Battery Life (9/10): The battery life is fine, they last pretty long. I'm studying for the Bar right now, so I used them for about 10 hours a day. They would last like a little over 10 hours for me before needing to be charged, and charging only took max 3 hours.**Connectivity (5/10): I had huge problems with connecting them to my Mac, I have no clue why. But, just so everyone knows, you need to download the app (Sony Connect) to connect it to your phone and your other devices. They just weren't discoverable on my Mac. I restarted my laptop and the the headphones, downloaded the app, connected them to my iPhone, updated my Mac, etc. It took me like 2 hours to get them connected to my laptop. I'm not sure if I am just technologically challenged or if they just aren't compatible with Apple products, but this process alone made me feel rage that I never thought I would feel.**Aesthetic (7/10): The headphones looked ok on. The ear part was kinda too clunky for my liking. They stick out a little more than other headphones, so I kind of felt like a bear when I wore them.**Overall (7.5/10): I think the headphones are meh. I just wasn't impressed for headphones that are rated sooooo highly in every article online. I did a lot of research and was torn between Sony WH-1000XM5, Sony WH-1000XM4, and the Bose QuietComfort 45. I decided against the Bose only because you cannot turn on/off the noise cancellation with buttons. So between the XM4 and XM5, I picked the XM5 because they were rated so well in online articles, I liked the look of them more (from pictures), and I figured I would just get the most up-to-date model. I returned them mainly because of the connectivity problems, noise cancellation, and sound quality. I just don't think they're worth the money, especially retail price. I just got the Sony WH-1000XM4 and they are SO MUCH BETTER. The sound/product quality, noise cancellation, connectivity, etc.Final Thoughts: If you want top of the line headphones and have the money to spend, get the Apple Airpods Max. If you want great headphones for a better price, Sony WH-1000XM4. The Bose are apparently SUPER comparable to the Sony WH-1000XM4 and are cheaper in price too. So, if having buttons to turn on/off noise cancellation is irrelevant to you, then get the Bose QuietComfort 45.The end.","June 13, 2023","3.0","Headphones are Mediocre","b","Color: Silver","True"

The long battery life is another great feature. You don't have to worry about plugging them in after only a few hours of use.There are a couple things I'd like to see improved.

I am coming here in hopes of helping someone else out with their frustration.If you're nervous about dropping the money, do it. The app (if you let it) will track your usage. Get them, set an alert for a day or two before the return period is up. Try them out and then check your usage when the alarm goes off. If you need/use headphones I almost guarantee youre going to find these worth it.RE: Small headsYour head might not be too small. I realized after two days of use I was fitting them more like traditional headphones and they were siting on one or two lobes very slightly.When you fit, and while you get used to putting them on, I suggest:- lengthening the headand (as app suggests)- 'scooping' your ears lobes up and inside the pads rather than under them at all- then gently fitting headbandOnce I started doing this my fit issues nearly dissappeared(hair..). Biggest issue now is the band material is not grippy at all and I have very smooth/slick hair, so it wiggles a bit. If I troubleshoot around this I will update.Of note and Re:Sensitive TemplesThese do not need to be as secure over all (other than having the suction over the ears) as you will not want these to get wet, period. These are not designed for exercise or heavy movement. They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable. Which for someone like me that gets migraines with nearly ANY temple pressure has been... life changing.The suction aspect for proper noise cancelation is fairly fundamental. It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way. I have already noticed that one or two small strands will absolutely affect the seal. I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones. If you experience this in one or both ears...check for anything preventing a seal! It's annoying to navigate but as with adjusting the fit as above the more I do it, the easier it is to do upfront/as second nature.The app is fairly easy to navigate but has a small learning curve, nothing atronimical. The only other app ive used for headphones was Jabra about 2 years ago. Theyve likely updated since but compared to the 2020 Jabra app..this app is night and day better in terms of navigation and ease of use.So far my only con has been switching between my TV and my phone. This could be me, I think this may just be a learning curve I havent yet had time to solve. What it was doing: Paired to both. Switched to phone to do some Duolingo. For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from. When I re-paused my TV I'd have to reselect my phone..and then it would do this again. So for now Im just leaving the TV unpaired. I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE. Everything else is  icing on the cake.If something changes I will absolutely return here to update.","January 18, 2023","5.0","Smaller heads, folks with hair, and sensitive temples..read this","Bast","Color: Black","True"

They have a matte finish which feels nice and grippy to the touch. The buttons have a nice feed back when pushing them. Compared to the 700s the feedback is night and day. For the 700s I would often think that I was hitting the button because it had such lite feedback with a squishy feel.The weight of the MX5 seems to be just a bit lighter than the 700s which I count as a positive because 700s relied more on the headband to carry the weight of the headphones versus clamping force against the ear cups. The MX5s have slightly lighter clamping force on the ear cups but not too little that they feel like they will fall off. They are a great balance of clamping force and weight that neither the headband nor the clamp force feel like they are carrying the full load.  The lighter weight and balanced clamping force make them very nice to wear for long stretches while working. Compared to the 700s I would often start feeling fatigue on my head where the headband would sit because all the weight was supported across it.The ear cups are also a bit wider on the MX5 but a bit shallower when compared to the 700s. I have ears that stick out a bit more so with the 700s the extra room is welcome. The shallower MX5 do fatigue my ears after a while of wearing them but this was after a full day of wearing them.The headband adjustment is a bit sticky for my taste. It's a bit difficult to adjust the MX5s because the fulcrum point get the leverage to adjust them sits much higher along the headband compared to the 700s which I can easily adjust with one hand if needed. However, its the 700s would also lose the adjustment very easily compared to the MX5s when moving around because they rubbed against a headrest.Noise CancellingI won't focus on the sound quality because I am not an audiophile. However, the noise cancelling is fantastic.  I would consider them to be a step above the 700s.Extra SettingsThe app gives you a ton of settings to play around with. The main things I find to be better than the 700s is that the MX5s bluetooth is much better. I live near a rather large radio antenna so interference with wireless signals is extremely high. Walking in the other room my 700s would start breaking and stuttering teh signal before disconnecting. The antenna for the MX5s must be better because I can go a bit give or take an additional 5-10 feet. Also when using connecting to 2 sources the switching is seemless. Once sounds stops on one device the second device starts playing right away. My 700s sometimes would refuse to switch and be stuck on one source until I would restart the device or manually disconnect one source.The app also lets you assign the noise cancellation double a triple tap actions to start a directly interact with a service like spotify. Actually only spotify. I wish the button customization would be opened up to other actions since I don't use spotify its a dead feature for me. The same button can also turn off/on noise cancelling but rather the headphones given a verbal sentence like ""Noise Cancelling 5"" to let me that I am in ambient sound mode. I need to learn the sound of 3 different tones. The 700s would do and I miss that feature and they would also let you customize the noise cancelling levels that you could cycle through.

The headset simultaneously quit playing audio. This was easily corrected by a brief touch of either the power of NC/AMB button, but recurred as soon as the microphone was used.After going through all the layers, and getting Sony-dot-com/support and ""chatting"" with a human agent, the problem was solved with a factory reset (headset off, then press and hold both buttons about 7 seconds, until there are 4 flashed of the blue LED.Negatives:The band is tight for me. I cannot imagine wearing these throughout a 4+ hour airplane flight.Your mileage will be different -- my wife finds them always comfortable.But that's part of the extremely effective noise reduction.The app's server initial connection was unreliable for me, and the login process far to ""secure"" with difficult capcha matches, and after each failure, one's password must be re-entered. But you don't need the app for excellent function.Positives:- Outstanding microphone noise cancellation. This is active all the time, whether or not ANC is on for listening.  Speaking over to phone from a coffee shop (ceiling music, arguing staff, dishes clanking, a family conversation and squalling baby 15 feet away), the listener could hear little or no background noise.It is very, very hard to get any information on actual performance on noise-canceling mics in buds or headphones. I finally found soundboys-dot-com, who way down near the bottom of their reviews have actual recordings in standardized noisy environments.I've slowly migrated, over 6 years, through three units:  First, an ANC open-ear headset with a boom mic that I assumed would work well because close to my mouth. My wife casually observed that I spoke very loudly when dictating, especially. I wrongly thought this because we don't hear our own voice well when our ears are covered.  Then I forgot these on the train, and bought Beats for convenience -- the band and magnetic latches in the buds make loss difficult. These surprised me by having MUCH better mic performance -- never needed to raise my voice in a quiet environment for good speech recognition.  But in noisy environments (riding in a car or airplane. sitting an an airport waiting area, cafe, etc.), they failed. With dictation, I had to cup my hand over my mouth and the mic to avoid unseemly shouting, and then quickly hold the mic in my hand to suppress the noise during my silences.  It's interesting to me that voice recognition works better with ANC off, because then I hear my own speech volume more accurately and can modulate that realistically. Yes, one does need to speak louder in a very noisy environment, or simply talk into one's hand to reflect the sound back to the mics when one wants to be private.  These Sony headphones are exactly what I need.For me, the excellent music quality is simply the frosting on the cake. - One can plug in a standard mini stereo plug and the phones just work..

They're certainly the best sounding headphones I've ever gotten.I own both the previous models, the WH-1000XM3 & XM4, and the quality of the sound, noise cancelling, and passthrough mode has gotten better with each iteration. The passthrough on these compared to the XM4's now feels lile night and day, as these allow me to hear my surroundings far better.However, I have had a few small issues with these. The redesign of the headphone strap looks and feels more modern with a higher build quality than the previous versions, and they're slightly lighter, but they're a bit more uncomfortable to wear for long periods. The strap is thinner, so the pressure on the top of my head is spread out over a smaller area, which begins to hurt after a couple hours if I don't wear a hat or hood to spread out the weight a bit. This is also somewhat avoidable by simply adjusting their position on my head every once in a while.One advantage these have over previous models is the ability to seamlessly switch between two connected devices, but this has it's issues. I use a Samsung phone and a Windows PC, so results may vary, but often the computer will just take control of the headphones despite not playing anything. For example, I double tap the right ear cup to pause something playing on my phone, then a few seconds later, do the same to resume it. For some reason, the headphones often decide to switch control to the computer during that brief pause window, resuming whatever was playing on it, or just doing nothing at all if nothing was playing. This happens even if all the audio on the PC is muted, no programs are open, and no media is or was playing.The XM4's had a handy solution for switching devices: NFC. I could hold my phone up to the headphones to quickly connect & disconnect it, making switching between devices quick even though only one could be connected at a time. I always knew which device the headphones were currently controlling. However, much to my surprise, the XM5's completely lack any NFC functionality. This would be fine, if connecting to two devices at once didn't have this issue. It's not a dealbreaker, though, as I just have to remember to disconnect them from my PC when I get up, or spend a few extra seconds getting my phone out of my pocket every time I want to resume something I was listening to.If you get these, here's a tip: don't clip your nails in passthrough mode. Something about the sound of clipping nails causes the passthrough mode to make a loud, high-frequency noise and shut off for about a second. This also happens for some other loud sounds, but clipping nails consistently causes it.In conclusion, I do believe that the XM5's were a worthy upgrade for me from the 4's. The improvements in noise cancellation are a godsend when there's constant noise around the house, which is all the time. I do wish there were an option to turn off the weird adjustments the ANC makes sometimes to try to adapt to the environment, as occasionally it will try to adjust each ear individually, resulting in a weird pressure sensation in my head due to the uneven audio cancelling.","January 9, 2024","4.0","Great ANC, Passthrough, and Audio Quality, but less comfortable and missing previous features","K","Color: Black","True"

So it was  a no-brainer.Prior to buying these headphones, I had used and loved my Jabra headphones which I still use and still love.  Sadly, while the Jabra's sound and ease-of-use was superb, the ear cushions did brcke down too""  And so I through, ""WTH . . . let's see what the Sony headphones are like.""What these do very well:  1.  Sound quality  I'm sure there are better headphones out there, but these are pretty danged good quality  2.  Comfort  Sony did well here.  I use them for making / taking calls and I can leave them on all day without a problem.  3.  Battery Life  Again, these last me a whole day -- making and taking calls and listening to music, radios and TVWhat these do NOT do well:  1.  External controls  Simply unacceptable when you need to change the volume from the headphones quickly and easily.  I own a different brand of headphones  (Jabra) that uses a 'mechanical' button to easily adjust volume -- the Sony headphones  require running your finger/s over the headphone's surface to make changes.  This functionality rarely works. And, when you  need to adjust the volume, it's extremely frustrating to do so using the headphones.  2.  Noise Cancelation  Again, a key frustration for me.  When I use it,  a different tone follows each  setting.  My Jabra uses actual voices vs. tones.  For example,  my Jabra says, ""Noise-cancelation OFF"" -- the Sony just emits a tone/ And, because the directions are so bad,  you can't find out what each tone suggests.  Also, the N/C functionality it far less effective at killing ambient noise than I find  I get from my other  headphones.  3. Software  Sony's software is far more complex than is actually needed to what it's designed to do -- LISTEN to good music, take calls, etc.  Even though Sony's manual allegedly explains how to use the software, due to its complexity of it, most won't use nearly  half of what it could do for you.  Again, a missed opportunity here, as well.QUESTION:  I'm often asked, ""Would I buy the Sony over the Jabra if I had to buy another set?""  Candidly, ""No, I wouldn't.  Why do  you ask?""  Both are good brands and the sound quality and ability to take / make calls are good (Though Jabra is better).  But the horrific  (IMHO) volume controls the Sony has as well as the noise-cancellation argue Sony made something good . .. good and complex.  Still, the SONY  headphones are good but they still need to refining them so they work as you'd expect.","July 28, 2024","3.0","Volume Controls Are Very Problematic","Bill Doerr","Color: Midnight Blue","True"

I had the XM4’s for a short time but had to return them because they were too creaky while wearing them. Luckily I have not had that same issue so far with the XM5’s. My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5’s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s. This helps them go over the ears better. However, the NC700s have slightly thicker padding which makes the inside of the cup a little deeper. For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods. The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s. But both are great.Sound QualityThis is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s. I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end. The XM5s really give a nice full bass, without it being over-bearing. I do prefer a bit more lower end than what the Bose provides. So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.Call QualityI use my headphones for work calls several hours a day. Both the XM5 and the NC700 have great call quality and will work really well if you use them for phone calls or Zoom meetings a lot. I think I’d give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.Noise CancellationI mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation. I will say, I was surprised at how much noise the XM5s can block out. They block out voices and medium pitched noises better than the NC700s. They are both great with lower pitched things like plane noise. But I think the XM5s do a better job overall.Build Quality and DesignThis is where the Bose NC700s are just better than the XM5s. The build of the NC700s is just beautiful. They feel substantial without being too heavy, and there isn’t a seam anywhere. I also think they just look amazing. The XM5s do have seams around the ear cups and they feel much more plasticky. The XM5s are not bad, but they just are not as good as the NC700s as far as design and build quality.Battery LifeThe battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours. The XM5s last around 25 hours. So it’s a pretty big difference. Charging speed seems about the same with both.Odds and EndsFeatures of each are similar. They both offer pass through audio and it works well on both. Touch controls work equally well on both. The case of the XM5s is a little bigger than the NC700s, if that matters to you. One small difference that may make a difference to some is that if you want to use the cord to plug them into a 3.5mm headphone jack, the end the plugs into the NC700s is 2.5mm. So if you lose the included cord, you will need a specific type of aux cord to replace it (2.5mm to 3.5mm). Whereas the XM5 uses a regular 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux cord.Overall I do like these Sonys better. I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose. But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, I’m going to be using the Sonys from now on.","February 4, 2023","4.0","Comparison to Bose NC700","mhans311","Color: Silver","True"

I enjoy high quality music components - my taste has always been heavily rooted in 70’s Rock.As a drummer, and a serious music collector, I still enjoy the drive, spectrum, and talent that produces each part of the music - even though it is now rarely evident in today’s world of “noise”.I used a set of Bose QC35 headphones as my means of listening to music while mowing grass on my ZTR.  These worked sufficiently while also giving an impressive rendering of music fidelity - all things being considered.After a few years I wanted to see if an upgraded setup was available  - so the research, shopping, and review reading led me to buy these Sonys - despite that brand name not being one commonly associated with HQ headsets in the audiophile realm.Honestly - “overall” - It has been a disappointing decision made thus far.  I get the feeling that the ANC is where the tech was implemented, not necessarily in the fidelity, styling, or sound drive.Other reviews adequately describe the somewhat cheap materials used.  The lack of any manual buttons or controls on the set, coupled with the total lack of any printed manual is cheap IMO.  Its case and packaging appear to be recycled - as a demonstration of Sony’s participation in the myth of climate change - so the tech stuff like “duo CPU and 8 mics” thing - gets a little drowned out.The folks at Bose use to piss everyone off in refusing to publish specs. They would reply “just give our speakers a listen”.  And to a large extent - I think that applies here.These headphones do have a very good frequency spectrum , SNR, and although I have not thoroughly tested it yet - I’d bet the ANC works very well.The minimalist will love the flat black (or silver) shaved exterior.  The one little paper included in the box (besides ads and the warranty) is a safety sheet that only lists ALL the MANY THINGS you should NOT do with them.  Nothing is written inside to say how they can be used or enjoyed.You must download the “CONNECT” app, create an account, and use the phone app to set up and control the headphones. NOTHING is possible without doing that.  (One more tether to tie you to your phone).Of course you read the terms and agreement when you open your account too - (and they wouldn’t dare use any of your PI, nor would your privacy ever be invaded).So I listened to the sound - and it is as good - perhaps a tiny bit better - than my Bose.But at a much higher cost - AND not until signing up & using the app to adjust the Sound. They are very lifeless without setting up the equalizer AND pushing the volume to FULL. This is a must.I’m not sure they even have the volume output of the Bose.  That is a major concern to me due to my particular use - AND that I do like music to be fairly loud (and clear).Lastly, iPhone users - if you don’t play the game of getting the latest iOs revisions, certain functionality may not be provided.  So iPhone users be sure to check on that.With such a price tag - and so many ties to endure - to gain and maintain full functionality with these, it may keep “fence sitters” like myself from returning them (after going through so much just to test them out).“Others” - who seem so thrilled - throwing 5 star reviews on everything they try, (and probably listening to compressed MP3 formats) will give Sony the goAhead on these.  But I am not so thrilled.  I like quality to be in all aspects of the equipment. And I like the USER to be in full control.There may be more to what Sony is getting here - than their customers.","March 21, 2023","3.0","Not worth the cost","M. Joy","Color: Black","True"

But in my research the sony headphones are superior in so many ways. I Initially was going to return the headphones because other Bluetooth devices connected to my iMac interfered with both sound and speaking through the headset. It does pair in with my iMac perfectly.But here’s why I kept them:they are better at blocking noise than Apple headphones and while they are more affordable, the sound quality is also better. The battery life is superior and the headphones can automatically shut off and save the charge. Its battery life is vastly superior and the phone calls I make are crystal clear and people can hear me without a problem while blocking out all noise when I link them through my phone. They do have a transparency mode and a mode that allows transparency to turn on when you speak. But my favorite feature is the noise cancellation. While it does apply a slight amount of pressure on the ears, it’s not enough to stop me from using the feature. The music plays at higher quality than the Apple headset and the headphones are set up to pause, accept, or swipe to the next call with the slide of the finger over the right side of the headset. They ante very comfortable and suitable for wearing during long periods. They are pretty light. Ultimately the only reason for me to buy (apple’s) VR a headset vastly more expensive with less quality would be because apples headset easily swaps from whatever device you are on. The iMac issue would also be resolved but I’ve found ways to resolve it with the Sony headphones, it’s just a little bit more trouble. So it is a little bit of pain to have to manually connect Bluetooth and setup the headphones for my Mac but not to the point that I wouldn’t recommend them.

I tried for several days over several calls and had the same result without any indiciation that it would improve, and since the goal of these was work calls over Teams and Zoom, I could not keep them.There are definite pros to this set though and I'm sure it's a me thing as far as why I was getting headaches (tons of reviews dispute my personal findings). The audio quality over BT was exceptional. I found it odd that it wouldn't work over USB-C while it charged, but maybe that's not an industry standard thing (my last headset did this so I got used to it). The connectivity was incredible; no issues with dropping during calls and very fast reconnecting. Handled multiple devices flawlessly. The app was nice. Overall I liked it but could not justify keeping it at this price when I couldn't wear it more than 1 hour.","July 22, 2024","4.0","Headaches after 1 hour of use but sound quality and connectivity were a win","nin","Color: Midnight Blue","True"

I specifically wanted to start using a high-quality microphone so that my voice would come through clearly and it wouldn't sound like I was talking into a cheap headset (which is exactly what I'd been doing previously). Based on my cursory research of reading reviews for various high-end headphones, it seemed like the Sony WH-1000XM5's were likely one of the best options I could possibly buy, so I ordered a pair and tried them out in my tutoring sessions for a few days.Audio: Probably the best audio quality of any headset I've ever used. Crystal clear sound and great noise-cancelling. My best experience of the headphones was walking around the house and listening to music, as I got to hear a greater depth and richness in some of my favourite songs than I'd ever heard before.Microphone: I recorded some short audio samples with this headset and a few other mics to compare quality, since getting a better mic for my online tutoring was one of the main reasons I bought this. It was definitely better than the cheap wireless earbuds I've been using for the past few years, but definitely not as good as the standalone JLAB microphone I bought for recording videos.Comfort: This was the main dealbreaker for me. No matter how I adjusted the extension or placement of these headphones on top of my head, I invariably started to feel discomfort and eventually pain in the spot where the central band made contact with my scalp. I could partially mitigate this by moving it to a different spot every ten minutes or so, but decided that this wouldn't be sustainable for multiple hours a day most days per week, so I returned the headphones.","November 10, 2024","3.0","Great audio quality, couldn't get comfortable","Dan Kinch","Color: Midnight Blue","True"

The Bluetooth connectivity can reach further than my smart watch. Battery life is so long that they don't even reach 50% battery after wearing them for over 12 hours. The included cables are as good as they need to be. The noise cancelling can bring a lawn mower engine down to around 50 db. They are very comfortable and are pretty adjustable.One star off because the headphones connect app is not very well translated. For instance: the factory reset button is written as ""Initialize settings"". Another issue I've had is the lack of a switch input button. When using dual input, the headphones occasionally do not switch because something on my computer is still technically playing audio. It will even fight manual changes in the app for the switching. The music provider specific functions are not ideal and I would prefer if the same functionality could be applied to any app.All in all, the noise cancelling performance of these headphones alone makes them worth the money.

Summertime is the worst. I have no idea why everyone on the planet is obsessed with mowing their lawn. I digress. I needed the top noise canceling headphones after they were casually mowing 4 days a week at my office. I kid you not. I can't handle it. These are phenomenal for canceling sound. My neighbor also blasts terrible music outside and these totally block that. However, for nearly 500 bucks, people should be able to hear me in a call. I can't yell in office and I shouldn't need to. I have sony noise ones and the call quality is significantly better. I appreciate how great these are for noise, but also dude they should be great in every category for the price imo. They charge very quickly and on the same charger as my phone, which I love. Usb c. Still, rather disappointing.. I also feel like the buttons are not super easy to understand. I.e. I didn't read those more than once and now I have to go back and read them.

Off the bat they were comically bassy. The app (which connected no problem, bravo!) has a handy EQ that I adjusted to really turn down the bass so that it didn't drown/muddy the entire rest of the spectrum... but then it just sounded kind of stale, like I adjusted so many ways but the clarity just wasn't there and music sounded bad like I was listening on cheap headphones when these otherwise should be so good. This might be a preference thing. I am biased toward Sennheisers sound, and I did try their Momentum 4 which sounded beautiful out of the box but the ANC just wasn't cutting it and it's ultimately what I'm getting noise cancelling headphones for. With EQ adjustment I thought the Bose Quiet comfort headphones had way more to work with sound quality wise and I kept the Bose in the end.Back to Sony... another thing I was disappointed by was the design of the earcups. They are so shallow that it sits on your ears and presses on them. Eventually the ears get hot and uncomfortable. I didn't get to the point of my ears hurting, however, because due to the shallowness it had nothing to hold onto, and while I was doing tasks like picking up dishes from the dishwasher or tying off the garbage bag, it would just slip off my ears and I'd have to stop what I'm doing to adjust. Super disruptive and not conducive to blocking sound when it slips off that easily.It's too bad because the ANC really is impressive. It goes real quiet. If you stay very still and don't mind your ears getting toasty, and love big bass above all other frequencies, buy these.I thought the minimalist design overall was very stylish but on my head the band didn't look as good as I had hoped. It is sort of a thick band and curves in a circular sort of shape that I don't think is flattering for me. Again I may be biased toward the Sennheiser look, which I think looks way more cool. But these ended up looking a bit dorky on me. Which I'd care about more if they even stayed on my head. These look better than the Bose QCs though.Touch controls work surprisingly well! Responsive sounds are pleasant. Very sensitive so I did set them off (skipped an entire song smh) while taking off a shirt, etc. I do think it's smart that a single tap does nothing and you have to double tap to play/pause, otherwise I'd be accidentally playing and pausing a lot. Sennheiser M4 does single tap play/pause so don't take it for granted.","September 12, 2024","3.0","ANC very good but bad ear cups and bad sound quality","N. Day","Color: Silver","True"

But be very aware there is NO IP rating!!! If you plan to use these for workouts and are worried about your sweat or rain ruining these be cautious due to there not being an IP rating.Included Case: The included case is nice. Glad one came with it due to the of course wild price.  Be aware though these headphones do NOT fold like the previous version. So yes the case is a little more bulk.Sound quality and Noise cancelling: The Sound quality is decent to pretty good. I will say I wish the equalizer was better with added channels to change. Despite sound quality being decent/pretty good the Noise cancelling is king on these! Sony has been Kong when it comes to noise cancelling and you WILL notice this with these.Features/Gimmicks: Now depending how you see these you may consider them to be Gimmicks or features. The Auto Adaptive sound control is pretty good. It will automatically adjust ambient noise depending what you're doing and it helps a bunch! Another feature or gimmick is speak to chat which can work but also not work. I've had times where I'm talking and it won't activate till after 5 seconds and sometimes 7 seconds. A point where time is crucial when speaking to someone you might as well take off the headphones or put your hand on the outer part of the headphones to instantly activate the ambient sound. So in terms of the speak to chat feature it can be seen more of a gimmick.Value for Money: This is the part where your wallet will cry and hurt. These are super expensive for headphones I must say! But In terms of Value for Money. It's at a crossroads of yes is it a good value but also not. But I will say this. You're better off getting these on a good discount. I got these on an early black Friday deal here on Amazon. But I found out on November 9th it was at a price of $255 using a price history extension for Google Chrome. So technically this deal they had on these for Black Friday was a really bad deal. So my compulsive buyer syndrome got the best of me. Overall all for price. Wait till these are $270 or less I would consider that a better deal!","November 23, 2023","4.0","Pretty Impressive! But Just a bit overpriced!","Anthony S.","Color: Black","True"

Does it work great if you’re playing music or something, yeah. Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs. I wouldn’t rate the “Surround Sound”/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job. That being said, it’s amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty… or Minecraft. Zero disappointment if you want clear audio since the ear cushion works wonders (Not sure how long they will last though). As for charging and using the audio Jack at the same time since Bluetooth doesn’t work while it’s charging, I found it a horrible experience. Just get a good charging brick, a decent length usb-c cable and charge the thing once it reaches 20%. Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasn’t lying about being able to reach 30 hours. Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level. I don’t plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point. As for the range, Bluetooth 5 is impeccable especially with a quality device and limited walls between you, your pc and the kitchen. As for volume control, it changes it by small increment, though holding on to the right pad with your palm does activate transparency mode and lower the volume so you can hear someone talk. Downloading the app will show you a few things btw. It’s just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you can’t deny the microphone quality. It’s quite good on mobile but if you use OBS to record there is always that noise. That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself. But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top it’s gold. If there was once feature they should’ve added it would be dual control on both ear cuffs instead of just the right. I’m not left handed but it would increase usability since I don’t always get the action I want done though to me lying down or whatnot and my hand gesture was a little off from the four main directions. Also can we get a PC App or settings? I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control. There are times when I forget to turn them back on and when I switch to PC/Mac I have to go back to my phone to turn those controls back on. If there is a desktop App, me not so bright. That being said, it’s a good product, just a tad overpriced. Let’s see how long I can keep it alive.","January 16, 2023","4.0","It’s not 100% Noise Cancellation","Worm","Color: Black","True"
