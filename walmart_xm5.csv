This is the greatest headphones ever!!!!! I have theAirPods Max but these definitely take the cake for the best high end wireless headphones let's see what chat gpthingsh dsays

The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones bring notable improvements to Sony's already beloved noise-canceling headphone lineup. Known for consistently topping the market in sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort, Sony's XM5s continue this legacy, although with some changes that users might have mixed feelings about.

Design and Comfort

The XM5s have a redesigned look, ditching the foldable hinges seen in previous models like the XM4s. Instead, they sport a slimmer, more minimalistic aesthetic with slightly larger ear cups and a thinner, more flexible headband. This change makes them lighter and even more comfortable, suitable for extended wear, but it also means they don't fold as compactly, making portability a little trickier. Sony does provide a hardshell case to protect them in transit, but some fans of the foldable design may miss the previous compactness.

Sound Quality

The XM5s offer a richer and more immersive sound experience than their predecessors. Sony has worked on fine-tuning the drivers, and the headphones now deliver slightly better clarity across the sound spectrum. Highs and mids are well-defined, while the bass remains punchy without being overwhelming. Sony's DSEE Extreme and LDAC support provide great audio fidelity, especially if you're streaming high-resolution audio from a compatible device.

Noise Cancellation

Sony's noise-canceling tech has always been industry-leading, and the XM5s improve on this even further. They use two processors and eight microphones to block out ambient sounds more effectively, especially in the mid- to high-frequency range. This makes them ideal for work in noisy environments or traveling, as they cancel out everything from office chatter to the rumble of trains. The XM5s also have an adaptive noise control feature that adjusts based on your activity and location, which can be useful for mixed environments but may feel unnecessary for some users.

Battery Life

Battery life remains strong with up to 30 hours on a full charge, matching the XM4s, even with the enhanced noise cancellation running. Plus, they support fast charging; just a 3-minute charge gives you around 3 hours of playback, which is a huge bonus for those on the go.

Features and Usability

The XM5s include intuitive touch controls for volume, play/pause, and skipping tracks, and these work seamlessly. Sony also upgraded the call quality; multiple microphones and AI-based noise reduction help make calls clearer and reduce background noise, even in busy environments. Multipoint connectivity lets you connect to two devices simultaneously, which is especially useful for those who frequently switch between a computer and phone.

Downsides

The XM5s come with a few trade-offs, though. The inability to fold them down as compactly as the XM4s might be a dealbreaker for some users. Additionally, they come at a higher price point than their predecessors, and while the improvements are substantial, some may feel the premium isn't entirely justified if they already own the XM4s.

Verdict

The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are among the best noise-canceling headphones available, offering superb sound quality, outstanding noise cancellation, and comfortable design. They're an excellent choice if you prioritize audio quality and noise cancellation over portability. However, if you already own the XM4s, the incremental improvements may not justify an upgrade unless the new design and slightly enhanced features are a big draw. Overall, the XM5s uphold Sony's reputation for high-quality audio gear and deliver a top-notch listening experience. THANKS CHAT GPTHISN","Sony!! Headphones!!!!!!","Billy biggles"

Self talk fold back when using for phone conversations via Bluetooth connection could be better. I am never sure whether I am taking loudly to overcome dampening - as clarity of self talk through internal speakers seems dull. 3.

First, the headband adjustment doesn't adjust for my head size. My head is smaller than the smallest size allowed by the headband. This gets bothersome because I want the headphones to fit my head snug, and they tend to fall/slide right off my head if I'm bending down to get something while I have them on. Also, the ear covering part swivels forward and backwards in an odd way. At times, it gets bothersome getting the right direction to put on the headphones because of this. One possible solution to this would be to add something to the ear cover part that would help find the right ear or left ear so a user using the headphones in the dark can easily find the correct ear cover and direction to place the headphones over the head and onto the correct ear, or the correct direction. Otherwise, these headphones are worth their weight in gold. LOVE LOVE LOVE MY WH1000 XM5","Best headphones hands down but…","biotune"

I blame it on the quite shallow earcups since the material feels soft. I looked at many competitors since and they all have way deeper earcups and feels better on the ear.  Also they are very prone for sweat as there is no room for breathing probably to give extra passive noise cancelling. 
Otherwise would be happy with them but again the discomfort is a show stopper for me.

Lots of great choices out there right now, but I narrowed my list down to the Sony® WH-1000XM5, or the Apple® Airpods Max.

I tested both.  Both sound fantastic, and worth the high price.

But I went with Sony.

>> Sound quality is 100% first class. All the frequencies are in perfect balance, and the difficult-to-get-right midrange is studio-perfect.

>> Packed with peerless technology, e.g. the headphones know when they are on or off your head, and when off they can automatically pause whatever you're listening to.

>> The active noise cancelling is absolutely superb.  Press a button and all exterior sounds are gone. For me, this feature works better than physical ear plugs, believe it or not.

>> Control the volume and other settings with gestures.  Swipe up and down on the right-side cup for volume control, etc. You also have the option to use voice commands.

>> Not 1, not 2 -- 8 microphones!  So you can make calls with these babies with 100% confidence.  This microphone abundance contributes much to the excellent active noise cancelling.

A bit disappointed that Sony decided to go with a plastic frame with instead of metal with WH-1000XM5. The Airpods Max headphones have a steel frame.  The plastic parts of my old (and legendary) Sony MDR V6 headphones actually started to crumble after a few years.  Steel doesn't have that problem.

Also disappointing:  The Sony Headphone Connect app is for mobile devices only.  I am a PC man.   A PC version would have been optimal.

NB1: As with all Apple products, headphone features work great with Apple software and hardware, and have certain drawbacks when used with PCs.  Sony doesn't have that drawback, and I am a Windows / PC person.

NB2: A full charge will give you 30 hours a play with the Sony WH-1000XM5. Apple Airpods Max = 20 hours with a full charge.","Sony® WH-1000XM5: Pricey, but worth it.","Rooster"

Seller emailed me and said that they confirmed delivery with the driver - not true.  There are no pictures and nothing was delivered.  I contacted the Walmart chat again.  They reached back out to the seller again.  They then responded with they needed 7 - 10 days to open a case with the delivery service.  This was a Christmas gift, so clearly this doesn't work.

First impressions were impressive. Used at home, it cut out all of the noise from children playing on the Nintendo Switch. However, on the commute, some sudden loud sounds do still come through and conversations from inconsiderate peers also sneak through. Not loud enough to be disruptive and only noticeable between songs.
Still running in the headphones but sound's been good so far. Used the auto programs for tuning the headphones but I think I will tweak it some more after everything's bedded in. The bass is punchy and controlled but the voices sounds rather thin, will need to tweak that part. Music is well staged and details are excellent. I am using LDAC through Samsung mobile. There are noticeable differences between the MP3 and Wav files.
The headphones are light but I tend to find I had to position it too tight on the top of my head to prevent it from slipping and thus creates a hot spot on the top of my head. Nothing  a bit of loosening won't help but I hate a wobbly headphones so will see how the head holds up. :)

The noise cancelling is excellent, sound quality great and the headphones are both light, comfortable and light.  My only disappointment is the noise cancelling level seems to vary automatically rather than maintaining a constant level.","Great Headphone","Nerdling"

They are on the larger side and don't compact for storage which I don't love but is common for the overhead style. They have a long battery life and great sound.

First of all, great set for the headphones, other than what I'll mention, these headphones get me through my day with great noise canceling and sound quality. The fit well and are more comfort than the last version (xm4). Now, with that said, there are 2 problems that affect my work and use of these headphones around other people. 1) When I'm in close proximity of others having a conversation, the noise canceling doesn't work up to 100%. When there is speech around me, the quality of the noise canceling turns to maybe 50-60% effectiveness and doesn't actually cancel noise around me. It think I'm trying to listen to them, but I'm just trying to listen to my podcasts. 2) My headphones randomly turn off. I'll be wearing them for maybe an hour or two Andy headphone just shut down. Not seeing a reason as to why. Not the biggest issue because it has only happened twice (not replicable). Other than those two issues, really solid pair of headphones!","Good headphones, but has a issues.","Erik_Hotch"

I hoped this would be an exceptional product but on delivery, I was disappointed. Since placing my order for this product, I downloaded the app Flacbox to my iPhone 8 and loaded FLAC music into the iPhone in readiness for the delivery of the new headphones. I was surprised to find my 2020 Phonak Audeo M90-R BT hearing aids played this music with surprising clarity - much better than WH1000XM5B headphones. The hearing aids seem much more efficient in that the breathing of artists can be heard and the overall reproduction is much more alive and realistic - the Sony MX5 headphones has slightly better bass but in general, the sound  seems muffled in comparison. A disappointment for me being a long time Sony customer - including purchasing a revolutionary (at the time) EL7 Elcaset in 1976. Why can't Sony produce its top shelf headphones with equivalent if not better performance than my Phonak hearing aids ? In Sony's defense, it should be noted that the Phonak hearing aids are much more expensive than the WH1000XM5B headphones. The control buttons need to be better visually identified. The MX5 headphones have the advantage over my hearing aids with its noise cancelling function eg when used in a vehicle or outdoors if subject to wind noise.","Not overawed","BJ74"

Definitely worth the upgrade if you've had the XM4's since launch as I have.

If you are comfortable with sharing some data, you can track your usage. This headphone is truly the complete package. It is expensive, so only buy it if you'll actually use it everyday. 
The only complaint I know is its inability to fold like the previous models. Harder to pack in a bag. In my opinion, not folding it reduces the odds of the hinge snapping, which the downfall of previous models. I see it as a worthy tradeoff.","Love these headphones","voiuya335"

Nope.
Sound: The drivers are fairly capable and the built-in amplification is adequate, giving these headphones pretty good definition, and I could hear details clearly. But that's about where the good news end: the tonality is horrible. Deeply boosted low end takes away energy from low-mid; high-mid is okay but not as tamed and smooth as it should be, resulting sometimes harsh and sibilant treble; highs over 10k Hz are just nonexistent. The EQ with the companion app is rather useless in that there are so few bands to choose from, and non of the bands they've provided can fix the troubled frequency regions. I've tried all possible combinations and it was impossible to make it sound anywhere natural and musical enough for any genre other than maybe Pop and Hip-hop. The wired connection has an even worse frequency response profile so I think it's safe to say Sony did not intend this pair of headphones for Hi-fi listeners at all, which makes their LDAC gimmick completely useless here. 
Comfort: Padding is the shallowest I've ever seen on any headphones, and the headbands are a curious circular shaped. The result? It starts to become irritatingly uncomfortable for me after just 20 minutes of wearing. I keep finding myself needing to adjust it from time to time, while my studio monitors can fit comfily for hours at a time.
ANC: coming from ANC earbuds mostly, XM5's system sound and feel weak to me. When compared to Airpods Pro 2, it felt quite different with more high frequencies but less low frequencies dampened. Maybe not worse, but certainly not better either. But compared to Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II? It is noticeably less effective, which it really shouldn't be given the high price tag.
Verdict: musicality wise the XM5 will lose to most wired studio headphones  $150 and above; convenience wise it will lose to most TWS earbuds; ANC is ok but definitely not top-notch; and it has questionable ergonomics. I love Sony's studio headphones but this one, it simply ain't it. If the XM5 retails for $250 and goes on sale for $200, it might be a competent pick; but as it stands for now, there are simply superior options at lower prices, making it IMHO a worthless buy for just about everyone.
3 stars for the hardware, minus one for the absurd price.","OK Device, Egregious Price, Music Lovers Be Warned","Moe"

It was between Sony and another competitor, and I'm very happy I listened to my friend's opinions as opposed to some online PAID reviewers.

I DO NOT get paid or any type of compensation, so this is honest and unbiased.

Been doing a lot of air travel lately, and these really make those 8+ hour flights zoom by, and when not enjoying my music the noise cancellation is JUST that.
Not sound-dampening, but “how did I get the screaming baby behind me so I'm gonna take a nap now” Noise Cancellation !!

Yes! don't be like those YouTubers comparing this with other headphone by not adjusting EQ!!! The EQ is there for everyone to make this headphone suit their own tastes! Not using it for reviews is just silly!! :) 

I have Apple AirPods Max, Bose QC35, Yamaha headphone and I can tell you, no other headphones beat this Sony M5! Its the best sounding headphone hands down! 

Now, the ANC is top notch, best in the market, someone was saying AirPods Max is better, I have both and I can tell everyone Sony is WAY BETTER than AirPods Max. 

Comfort, it is now very very comfortable, if you have used Bose QC35, you can expect the same comfort level. I don't even remember I am wearing a headphone. (Apple AirPods Max is not comfortable at all for me, its too heavy and for a glasses wearing person, AirPods Max is just not good)

Last but not least, the voice call quality outdoor is the best, Sony managed to remove nearly all background noise during voice call, no other headsets can do this.  I was walking on a busy street while having a phone call with my sister, she can't tell I was on the street. It is THAT good! :)

- active noise cancelling does its job;
- when on battery sound quality is good;
- when wearing glasses, passive insulation is ok with it (not perfect, of course, and not for thick temples);
- overall comfortable, though active noise cancelling could become uncomfortable for ear after some time of continuous wearing;
- could be somewhat flattened and fit backpack, have case as well;

It's a shame that the controle software for the MX5 is not very stable, as if there are to many options and movements that is confusing at times. What word to use to activate the ambient sound or when I take of the headphone and it pause the source. When it works it's fantastic but it doesn't always work witch is a bit confusing.
Then there is the matter of the smaller head band, what can be a bit painful after a few hours and I have to hove it around a lot after some time on my head. In that regard the MX2 was much less painful.

These headphones last anywhere from 2-4 days depending on the use, and they charge really fast (one time, 50% in 30 minutes).
Sound: They sound great! Sometimes when Discord (which means this might be a problem with Discord) uses the headphone as input at the same time as output, everything sounds terrible. However, when I use my actual separate mic, the issue is fixed immediately.
Mic: do not use so I don't know
Hand motions: Very easy to use and handy, especially on mobile
Noise cancelling: The noise cancelling is so good I don't hear when people open my office door that is about 10 feet away from me. I wore them on the plane the other day and they worked great. The only problem is when the headphones don't completely cover your ears, the noise cancelling effect is useless on the plane. This presents a problem when I'm chewing, for example, because every time my jaw opens it creates a little space between ear and headphone. This is only a problem on the plane; otherwise chewing does not noticeably affect noise cancelling. Overall, I am very happy with the noise cancelling. These are my first noise-cancelling headphones, though, so I don't have much to compare them to.
Connection: Once paired, these headphones connect to my computer within 5 seconds of turning both devices on. Usually I use them while I'm sitting right in front of my computer, and I very rarely have problems with songs ""buffering"" or cutting out for a split second. Being further away, (15-50 feet is the range I've tried) this buffering is more common, sometimes happening more than every 10 seconds, but sometimes not happening at all.","Long-lasting, good noise-cancelling","HolyJoe"

I own the xm2,xm3 and xm4 and every new generation seems to be a big improvement over previous generations. The guys in the sound department clearly aren't satisfied to sit back and keep doing the same even though the xm4 was excellent and still is. Somehow they managed to make the audio better, the noise cancelling better and the comfort better. The sound is beautiful and well rounded. The noise cancelling is next level and not just on planes and public transport even in a quiet situation you will probably need to be good at lip reading if someone is talking to you. I like the redesign, my hair doesn't get caught in the slide of the headband and the comfort is improved further. They've still managed to keep the price realistic for what you get and if you are on the fence don't be, you won't find anything better.","As good as it gets","Matt27"

For example, if I exhale too loud the ANC almost stops and I experience a sudden, loud disruption to my quiet while the headphones make some sort of change. The louder your environment the worse it is. It happens too frequently to be acceptable. I bought these for the ANC capability and the software lets the customer down because I cannot turn the feature off that causes these sudden changes. I want the headphones on maximum NC at all times without the loud reduction in ANC if I breath too hard, take a sip of water or respond to someone asking me a question. Sony really needs to provide an option in the app for users to control the ANC and to turn the feature off that causes such sudden changes in the ANC level. Once this issue is fixed I would be happy with them, but not until then. The sound quality is very good but it does not compensate for the ANC problem.","Disappointed w/NC control","Cm22C"

First. the noise cancellation is excellent. The sound fidelity is superb. These are full of useful features, or if you don't like too many features and want them to be simple, you can turn those features off. 1) Has a touch pad on the ear that makes is so simply to swipe my finger forward or backward to skip songs, or swipe up or down to adjust the volume. If you inadvertently hit the touch pad with your hand, you will usually accidentally tap it only once, and one tap is a non-operational tap sequence so all it does does is beep. 2) Has a speak to chat feature. If you start speaking, the sound will mute (or pause, I can't remember which). You can adjust the sensitivity in the app on your phone. The app, by the way, is excellent. Someone finally made a decent configuration app. 3) If you want to immediately hear something, like an announcement on a train, just hold your palm against the right earpiece/touchpad. Let go when you're ready to go into your silent cocoon and listen to music again. 4) Adjust equalization with a separate bass boost function. This works very well, and it doesn't seem to noticeably affect battery life. In fact, with all of these features, I'd expect the battery life to be poor, but it's not. They're rated at 30 hours, and I'm getting at least 20, and probably more like 25 hours. 5) One of the settings allows ambient noise to come in so you can hear your surroundings. There are two settings available for how much ambient noise can come in. This is for when you might be walking or running in a busy environment and need to have some awareness of your surroundings. The headphones will detect if you're sitting still (activates full noise cancelling), walking (activates letting in a low level of ambient noise), running (activates higher level of ambient noise), riding transit (full noise cancellation). You can turn off the automatic switching if you don't like it. You do this in the app. 6) Alternatively, based on location, it will adjust it's mode of how much ambient noise it lets in. You specify the location (it uses your phones location system and a map), or it will suggest locations for those that you frequently go to. This feature I think drained my phone battery very fast. After I turned off location detection, my phone battery use was normal again. I can't believe how much engineering went into these phones and how much time was spent making that companion app actually useful and highly functional. Sony rocked it on these headphones. I can't imagine there's a better pair out there. I chose these over Bose, and I'm gladd I did, although I don't have Bose, so I can't compare them. These were rated as having better noise cancelling technology (they kept out more noise than Bose) according to the study I read and graphs I viewed. You won't get the features in the Bose headphones, but you'll no doubt like those as well. If you want features, these are the headphones for you. Oh, yes. All of that effort you put into configuring the app? Guess what? You can set it to automatically back up your settings to Sony. I used an existing account I had with Sony that I set up for my Blue-ray player years ago.","Full featured with excellent noise cancelation","SoundHound10658"

Noise cancellation algorithm needs to improve immediately. In most circumstances, it works well but when I was on a bus and the bus is bumping, it actually didn't cancel the noise of the bumping. Whenever there's bumping, the headphone will produce a noise like a bass drum which double the bumping noise. It's also not quite effective at canceling traffic noise (mostly tire noise).

I need great noise canceling for calls and work meetings, and for it to stay on and not to distract me. If you get a break, put the set down for a little bit, it turns off, as a new is battery saving feature. I had to turn it back on and ask people to wait for my set to restart and link and all that. I know you can disable that from the phone app, but then it gas ding notifications as you walk or talk or change settings, and the adaptive noise canceling turns off. It was dependent on a phone app for location and settings. Way too complicated and distracting. It is a very cool gadget, but I just need reliable headphones.

Some headphones have better soundstage and separation/clarity, some have better audio freq balance, some MAY have advanced noise cancelling which affects the audio less, and some MAY be more comfortable to the individual.

NONE have as good of a balance of all of these like the XM5's. The sound was muddy and very over bass heavy out of the box… but after spending 10 mins tweaking the eq from the “bright” preset, they honestly now sound phenomenal.

Battery life - not industry leading anymore, but still excellent.
App - excellent, and surprisingly user friendly considering the multitude of features.
Mic - one of the best for phone calls, probably won't be bettered for a long time and will continue to be serviceable for years.
Price - expensive, but absolutely worth it if you have the cash

Travelled by plane, did some yard work, listen to movies and used the to do chores around the house. The sound quality is pretty good and with the app, you can customize the sound level.  The automatic digital equalizer does a good job to find the proper equilibrium for your ear.  I wish, however, that there could be different sound settings for different application (like a receiver) so that for certain movies you could accentuate the voice to be clearer while other event, you could want more bass, etc..  Maybe with what the headphones are paired with, you could make the different automatic settings or have functions, on your headphones to change settings. The battery life seems to last a good amount of time. When you put on the headphone, a voice telling you how much % battery life could be a nice touch (or at least be optional on the app).  The noise cancellation is really good in most settings.  However, i did not notice that, when using my lawn more, it didn't do a good job in the noise cancellation. I was surprised by this since it is a steady sound that I would have believe the opposite sine wave could have been generated to cancel this noise, but that wasn't the case.  The weed wacker had a better outcome by cancelling the sound most of the time. if I moved my head a bit, the headphone had to adjust, but it did the job.  However, the lawn more, I didn't have any luck with it.  The airplane was great pure quietness.  One more thing.  I believe that there should be more padding on the top of the headphone.  During the first few times, I could feel the presence of the headphone.  After a while you get used to it and it doesn't bother you anymore. But, at first, it did bother me. I believe that if it had more cushioning or a "" GEL"" type of cushion, it might be better.","Great headphones but not perfect yet","CA Sunshine"

They really do live up too the hype. The ONLY flaw is the adjustability, the sliding adjustments would be better if they had something to lock the adjustment levels into place, the only reason I say that is if I wear my headphones for a long period of time I find sometimes they slide/adjust a little looser ( only a few centimetres) but still it is a little annoying.

These headphones last anywhere from 2-4 days depending on the use, and they charge really fast (one time, 50% in 30 minutes).
Sound: They sound great! Sometimes when Discord (which means this might be a problem with Discord) uses the headphone as input at the same time as output, everything sounds terrible. However, when I use my actual separate mic, the issue is fixed immediately.
Mic: do not use so I don't know
Hand motions: Very easy to use and handy, especially on mobile
Noise cancelling: The noise cancelling is so good I don't hear when people open my office door that is about 10 feet away from me. I wore them on the plane the other day and they worked great. The only problem is when the headphones don't completely cover your ears, the noise cancelling effect is useless on the plane. This presents a problem when I'm chewing, for example, because every time my jaw opens it creates a little space between ear and headphone. This is only a problem on the plane; otherwise chewing does not noticeably affect noise cancelling. Overall, I am very happy with the noise cancelling. These are my first noise-cancelling headphones, though, so I don't have much to compare them to.
Connection: Once paired, these headphones connect to my computer within 5 seconds of turning both devices on. Usually I use them while I'm sitting right in front of my computer, and I very rarely have problems with songs ""buffering"" or cutting out for a split second.

My experience and review is based on my comparison to my old BOSE QC 35 II headphones.

Pros:
* Aesthetically pleasing headphone design.
* Awesome mids and bass.
* Earpad does not show any signs of wear after 7 months of usage.

Cons:
* Buggy firmware, the headphone will randomly crash for no reason (and yes I have updated to latest firmawre)
* Not as ""airy"" and comfortable as Bose QC 35
* Capactive touch awful to use - simple changing track commands, volume up/down now takes much long for a simple press due being a capactive sensor instead of physical button.
* For some reason sony does not have a function to permanently disable the speak-to-chat. Being capactive touch, it is quiet easy to reactive the speak-to-chat feature by touching the headphones. On most occasion it re-activated itself and you find yourself 'awaiting voice commands' instead of listening to your music.
* Prolong usage of these headphone cause uncomfort to my ears, after 3-4 hours of usage it becomes uncomfortable and if you're a sweat machine like myself this is problem exacerbated. The headphone are not ""airy"" or vented as the QC 35's
* Crap bluetooth firmware for switching in-between multiple connected bluetooth devices. For some reason the sony firmware does an awful job switching between multiple devices (Phone, laptop, PC). There is no quick way to switch between devices, you are forced to use the in-built app to switch devices, on the BOSE QC 35, its just a physical button that instantly switches between multiple devices.

At the price point sony is offering, I would not recommend this if your old headsets were similar to the BOSE QC 35 or if you have headphone that have physical buttons or not control by a mobile phone app!","Awful headphone","sudobede"

They are mostly focused on the person that wear the headsets not the person on the other end of the line. I would not be wrong if I tell you that they are making the things worse for the other person, by amplifying the background noise not the person's voice.

WH-1000XM5 on the other hand are different and deserve 5 stars for that. I was able to have a normal conversation over the phone while walking outside in regular city traffic. I am not living in a big city like LA or NY but these headsets may perform well even there.
My wife told me that I sound like I am in the office.

The battery life is very good; I wear these for 3 weeks now listening on them 30 min every weekday and so far I didn't charge them at all. I like also the audio quality though so far I used these only for podcasts with limited music content.

Now for the not so good part. When I turn the ANC on, I can feel the noise cancelling kicking in, but I can still hear helicopters, airplanes, noisy traffic or even wind. I do believe that a larger ear cup with more foam could help with this issue. I heard that the ear cups are smaller than on WH-1000XM4 and frankly I would prefer these to be a bit larger.

Also the manual shows these as not being sweat proof and unfortunately after wearing these for a half an hour I do find sweat under the ear cups.

When I turn my head left or right it will increase the noise that comes from the outside. Not sure if it's related to the headband being more rigid or to the frame of my sunglasses keeping the cups at a certain distance from the ear.

The tactile control works good, is responsive, and provides feedback similar to the airpods, but I should read the manual to learn about all the features.

Overall I am pleased with the purchase and I would recommend this product.

PS: I didn't own the WH-1000XM4 but I listened to some audio samples in a review and WH-1000XM5 seems to do a better job on noise canceling than WH-1000XM4.","Best noise canceling on phone calls","Cornel G"

It handles constant noise like engine, droning or road noise really well. Even conversation and intermittent noises are softened, to a much greater degree than my previous ANC headphones.

In general the quality of sound is really great, probably the best I've owned. They seem a little muddy on the high end but with the treble boost EQ setting I've found the sound pleasing. I haven't watched mich video but there seems to be little to no audio lag on my phone (Pixel 6 Pro). The touch controls seem consistent and good, though I still tend towards controlling volume and skipping on my phone. Battery life is amazing as expected.

It didn't disappoint! FYI to those who don't know, the sound balance of these headphones are different when used wired or wireless. They're more neutral sounding when wired (which is how I wanted them to sound), and they're more bass oriented when wireless. I use this for sound mixing on my PC, and I used it wired most of the time. That's why the big case and the ""no-fold"" mechanism compared to that of an XM4 didn't bother me much.

The noise cancellation is even way better than what I've experienced when I tried on my friend's XM4. Ambient mode is not that great, tbh.

However, in what it gained, it also lost some of its portability compared to the previous generation and it's slightly less comfortable. After around 30-40 minutes of use, the headphones start making my ears hurt, likely due to the smaller sized earcups. In terms of portability, the bulk of the new case makes it harder to stash away than their predecessor. And in terms of wearability, it's easy to dirty the inside of the earcup when wearing the headphones around your neck if you're eating. As someone who loves wearing the headphones around my neck, I prefer the previous generation's (Sony WH-1000XM4) to have the earups rotate the operational end of the cup inward against my body so that the drivers and inside cup don't get damaged if I spill something or food lands on the headphones while they're on my neck. Another issue I have is the absence of quick pair via NFC which I utilized heavily on the previous WH-1000XM4. The lack of the feature on the XM5s is more inconvinient as it means I have to go into my phone's bluetooth settings to connect to the headphones after using them with my laptop. This, however,  is where the XM5 really improved, making switching between devices easier as it immidietly connects to the device I'm switching to while disconnecting the device I was using almost immediately. This was a welcome addition to the headphones and it alleviates the problems I had with the removal of NFC pairing/connecting.","Best in class Consumer Grade headphones","MDHEXT"

The most standout aspect of these over my previous Sony WH-CH700N is the level of quality in the ANC. I'm finding my volume levels are across the board lower with the WH-1000XM5. It handles constant noise like engine, droning or road noise really well. Even conversation and intermittent noises are softened, to a much greater degree than my previous ANC headphones.

In general the quality of sound is really great, probably the best I've owned. They seem a little muddy on the high end but with the treble boost EQ setting I've found the sound pleasing. I haven't watched mich video but there seems to be little to no audio lag on my phone (Pixel 6 Pro). The touch controls seem consistent and good, though I still tend towards controlling volume and skipping on my phone. Battery life is amazing as expected. The headphones are comfortable, I have a large head and find that even with sunglasses on they sit well.","Amazing ANC","Highbread"

WH-1000XM5 on the other hand are different and deserve 5 stars for that. I was able to have a normal conversation over the phone while walking outside in regular city traffic. I am not living in a big city like LA or NY but these headsets may perform well even there.
My wife told me that I sound like I am in the office.

The battery life is very good; I wear these for 3 weeks now listening on them 30 min every weekday and so far I didn't charge them at all. I like also the audio quality though so far I used these only for podcasts with limited music content.

Now for the not so good part. When I turn the ANC on, I can feel the noise cancelling kicking in, but I can still hear helicopters, airplanes, noisy traffic or even wind. I do believe that a larger ear cup with more foam could help with this issue. I heard that the ear cups are smaller than on WH-1000XM4 and frankly I would prefer these to be a bit larger.

Also the manual shows these as not being sweat proof and unfortunately after wearing these for a half an hour I do find sweat under the ear cups.

When I turn my head left or right it will increase the noise that comes from the outside. Not sure if it's related to the headband being more rigid or to the frame of my sunglasses keeping the cups at a certain distance from the ear.

The tactile control works good, is responsive, and provides feedback similar to the airpods, but I should read the manual to learn about all the features.

Overall I am pleased with the purchase and I would recommend this product.

PS: I didn't own the WH-1000XM4 but I listened to some audio samples in a review and WH-1000XM5 seems to do a better job on noise canceling than WH-1000XM4.","Best noise canceling on phone calls","Cornel G"

What word to use to activate the ambient sound or when I take of the headphone and it pause the source. When it works it's fantastic but it doesn't always work witch is a bit confusing.
Then there is the matter of the smaller head band, what can be a bit painful after a few hours and I have to hove it around a lot after some time on my head. In that regard the MX2 was much less painful.

I need great noise canceling for calls and work meetings, and for it to stay on and not to distract me. If you get a break, put the set down for a little bit, it turns off, as a new is battery saving feature. I had to turn it back on and ask people to wait for my set to restart and link and all that. I know you can disable that from the phone app, but then it gas ding notifications as you walk or talk or change settings, and the adaptive noise canceling turns off. It was dependent on a phone app for location and settings. Way too complicated and distracting. It is a very cool gadget, but I just need reliable headphones.

- active noise cancelling does its job;

- overall comfortable, though active noise cancelling could become uncomfortable for ear after some time of continuous wearing;
- could be somewhat flattened and fit backpack, have case as well;


Not good:
- terrible sound when on AUX cable without post-processing, meaning could not be really used without charged battery;
- if connected via cable cannot enable the said post-processing, need to disconnect first, then power on;
- Bluetooth does not connect when headphones are plugged via cable, makes it difficult to use phone app;
- it is not possible to really disable touch buttons, they still continue to produce sound when touched;
- surface is fingerprints magnet, not that obvious but still not eye pleasing (I have black coloured version);
- AUX cable is a bit lacking, also - very subjectively and to me personally - angled cable is inconvenient.","ok","Alexey"

For example, if I exhale too loud the ANC almost stops and I experience a sudden, loud disruption to my quiet while the headphones make some sort of change. The louder your environment the worse it is. It happens too frequently to be acceptable. I bought these for the ANC capability and the software lets the customer down because I cannot turn the feature off that causes these sudden changes. I want the headphones on maximum NC at all times without the loud reduction in ANC if I breath too hard, take a sip of water or respond to someone asking me a question. Sony really needs to provide an option in the app for users to control the ANC and to turn the feature off that causes such sudden changes in the ANC level. Once this issue is fixed I would be happy with them, but not until then. The sound quality is very good but it does not compensate for the ANC problem.","Disappointed w/NC control","Cm22C"

I have the XM4 buds, but one got run over by a car. I then bought the XM5 buds and I still love them. I have a Bravia 52"" TV from 2008 that's still going strong. I loved the WH-1000XM5 headphones until they started feeling loose after about 6 months after purchase. I then noticed that the right side had actually physically broken. There were no traumatic experiences with these headphones. Just the normal usage and travel using the included case. Support was provided by a bot telling me the physical frailty wasn't a warranty issue and referring me to a repair depot in NY. YMMV but Sony has changed. Performance was good while it lasted but get as extended a foolproof warranty as you can. Consider that a part of the price.","Sonically great but physically frail for the price","Cross"
